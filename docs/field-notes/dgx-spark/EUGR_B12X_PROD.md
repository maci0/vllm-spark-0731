# Production on the eugr b12x image: fp8_ds_mla KV + DSpark + b12x

Target: 3-5 concurrent sessions, a 1.5-2.5M token KV pool, DSpark speculative
decoding, b12x kernels, and as few patches as possible.

This replaces the stage-c path ([PROD_C5_SSD.md](PROD_C5_SSD.md)), which never
reached a serving state. The eugr image serves, and it does so with a **73-line
recipe and zero `pre_exec` hooks**, against 344 lines plus an overlay rebuild.

Recipe: [`examples/eugr-prod.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/eugr-prod.yaml). Stock image, no patches.
[`examples/eugr-prod-nvfp4.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/eugr-prod-nvfp4.yaml) is kept only as a
record of the NVFP4 attempt that **does not work**, see §4.

## 1. Why this image

Every candidate was inspected directly rather than trusted from its name
(`docker run --entrypoint bash <img>` + grep of the installed `vllm` tree):

| Image | vLLM build | `nvfp4_ds_mla` | `fp8_ds_mla` | b12x | DSpark |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **eugr nightly `2026081903`** | `dev20003` (Aug 15) | ✅ 10 files | ✅ 27 | ✅ 74 refs | ✅ 48 |
| eugr nightly `latest` | `dev19043` (Aug 14) | ✅ 10 | ✅ 23 | ✅ 68 | ✅ 36 |
| `arena-b12x-modbaked` | `dev19043` (Aug 13) | ✅ 10 | ✅ 23 | ✅ 68 | ✅ 36 |
| `eugr/spark-vllm-b12x:latest` | `dev19024` (Aug 9) | ✅ 10 | ✅ 23 | ✅ 67 | ✅ 34 |
| stage-c / `tonyd2wild-arena` | `0.21.1rc1` | ✅ 6 | ✅ 25 | ✅ 45 | ✅ 21 |

`2026081903` is newest on every axis, so it is the one shipped here.

**bjk110 v027 is not a candidate for this workload.** Its own production preset
(`presets/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-k7-256k-v027-candidate-tp2.env`) runs
`--moe-backend marlin`, i.e. no b12x, and targets 256K context with a 10 GiB FP8
KV pool at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=1`. Useful ideas were still taken from it: see
`--kv-cache-memory-bytes` in §5.

---

## 2. The config

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| container | `ghcr.io/spark-arena/dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x:2026081903` | newest build with b12x + both MLA KV quants + DSpark |
| model | `drowzeys/keys-DeepSeekV4-Flash-GA-0731-Dspark-Abliterated-32-32` | gated, 156 GB, ships the DSpark draft head |
| `kv_cache_dtype` | **`fp8_ds_mla`** | the only MLA KV quant DeepSeek-V4 supports on this image, see §4 |
| `max_num_seqs` | **6** | 5 sessions + 1 headroom. Spec-decode buffers scale with `max_num_seqs x (k+1)`, so raising this silently takes memory from the KV pool |
| `num_speculative_tokens` | **5** | must be <=5 or a multiple of `n_predict=5`; k=7 boots then crashes on first generation |
| `gpu_memory_utilization` | **0.89** | 0.85 leaves too little KV for a single 1M request, see §3 |
| `max_model_len` | 1,048,576 | vLLM requires the KV pool to hold at least one max-length request |
| backends | `--moe-backend b12x --linear-backend b12x --attention-backend B12X_MLA_SPARSE` | confirmed live via `Using 'B12X' Mxfp4 MoE backend` |

No `pre_exec` hooks, no overlay rebuild, no offload connector, no `kill` shim.

---

## 3. KV capacity, measured

The per-token cost was measured on this image, not assumed. vLLM's own sizing
error states the arithmetic exactly:

```
To serve at least one request with the model's max seq len (1048576),
(11.04 GiB KV cache is needed, which is larger than the available KV cache
memory (10.85 GiB) ... estimated maximum model length is 1001216
```

11.04 GiB / 1,048,576 tokens = **~11.0 KB/token for `fp8_ds_mla`**.

| dtype | KB/token | 1.5M needs | 2.5M needs | available here |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `fp8_ds_mla` | ~11.0 (measured) | 15.8 GiB (util ~0.89) | 26.3 GiB (util ~0.98) | **yes** |
| `nvfp4_ds_mla` | ~6.6 (projected) | 9.4 GiB | 15.7 GiB | **no**, see §4 |

**Consequence: ~2.5M is out of reach on this image.** It would require NVFP4 KV,
which DeepSeek-V4 does not support here, and util ~0.98 on fp8 leaves nothing for
activations. Realistic range on the eugr lineage is **1.65M at util 0.89**, with
higher utilization traded against stability.

### Utilization ladder, measured

| util | KV pool | tokens | outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0.85 | 10.85 GiB | ~1.00M | **fails**: below the 11.04 GiB needed for one 1M request |
| **0.89** | ~17.4 GiB | **1,652,056** | **serves**, benchmarked in §6 |
| 0.91 | 18.7 GiB | 1,941,101 | allocates, then the **worker is SIGKILLed** mid-allocation |
| 0.92 | n/a | n/a | **fails at startup**: `Free memory on device cuda:0 (111.46/121.69 GiB)` |

**0.89 is the shipped value.** 0.91 is instructive: the head reports the full
1,941,101-token pool and keeps going, while the worker dies during allocation
with no error, no traceback, and no CUDA OOM. It is not the OOM killer either,
`/proc/vmstat oom_kill` stays 0 on both nodes and the container reports
`OOMKilled=false` with cgroup `oom_kill 0`. The only trace is bash reporting the
signal in the worker's own log:

```
/tmp/sparkrun_serve.sh: line 26:   120 Killed   vllm serve drowzeys/...
```

The head then hangs in `shm_broadcast` forever. Treat a silent worker death at
KV allocation as "utilization too high", and note that this is invisible from the
head log alone.

Between runs, always clear `/dev/shm` on **both** nodes. Orphaned segments from a
killed run consume the same DRAM the GPU allocates from, so they silently lower
the ceiling on the next boot. [`scripts/spark-launch.sh`](../../../scripts/spark-launch.sh)
does the teardown, the two-node sweep and the launch in one step.

---

## 4. `nvfp4_ds_mla` does NOT work on this image. Do not chase it.

**Tested and closed.** DeepSeek-V4 cannot use NVFP4 KV on the eugr image. The
capability is genuinely absent, not merely gated, and there are two separate
gates that must both be understood before anyone retries this.

**Gate 1, `vllm/config/vllm.py` (over-broad, patchable):**

```python
if (self.cache_config.cache_dtype.startswith("nvfp4")
        and self.model_config.use_mla):
    raise ValueError("nvfp4 KV cache is not supported with MLA ...")
```

`startswith("nvfp4")` also matches `nvfp4_ds_mla`. Narrowing it to exact
`"nvfp4"` does let config validation pass, and
[`scripts/sitecustomize-nvfp4-mla-guard.py`](../../../scripts/sitecustomize-nvfp4-mla-guard.py)
does exactly that. **It gets you to gate 2 and no further.**

**Gate 2, `vllm/models/deepseek_v4/attention*.py` (real, do NOT patch):**

```python
assert kv_cache_dtype.startswith("fp8"), (
    "DeepseekV4 fp8_ds_mla layout only supports fp8 kv-cache, got nvfp4_ds_mla")
```

The DeepSeek-V4 model path hardcodes the fp8 packed layout. The generic MLA
layers (`mla.py`, `mla_cache_format.py`, `b12x_mla_sparse.py`) do carry
`nvfp4_ds_mla` support, which is why grepping the image suggests it works, but
the DeepSeek-V4 writer is fp8-only. Forcing this assert would mismatch the cache
layout and produce silent numerical corruption instead of a clean failure, so it
is deliberately left alone. Supplying that writer is exactly what the stage-c
overlay's "padded `nvfp4_ds_mla` writer" existed for.

**Practical consequence:** on the eugr lineage the KV pool is fp8_ds_mla at
~11.0 KB/token, and capacity is bought only with `gpu_memory_utilization`.

NVFP4 KV **is** reachable, but only on the stage-c stack, whose overlay supplies
the missing sm12x DeepSeek-V4 writer. That is measured, not theoretical:
`../../../configs/examples/stagec-nvfp4-prod.yaml` serves **2,198,373 tokens** with
`kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla` confirmed live in the log. See §9 for the
head-to-head.

The patch script is kept only as documentation of gate 1 and is **not** part of
the shipped recipe. If revisiting: `VllmConfig` is a pydantic *dataclass* whose
schema is built at class creation, so mutating
`__pydantic_decorators__[...].func` does nothing and `rebuild_dataclass(force=True)`
re-collects the original. Only rewriting the module source before class creation
works, and it must be verified on the compiled object rather than with
`inspect.getsource`, which re-reads the file and shows unpatched text:

```python
f = VllmConfig.validate_nvfp4_kv_cache_with_mla
assert "startswith" not in f.__code__.co_names
```

---

## 5. Ideas taken from the bjk110 v027 preset

`--kv-cache-memory-bytes 10737418240` pins the KV pool to an exact byte count
instead of reverse-engineering it from `gpu_memory_utilization`. Given the
measured KB/token in §3 this is the more deterministic dial:

```
1.5M tokens  fp8_ds_mla -> --kv-cache-memory-bytes 17716740096   (~16.5 GiB)
2.0M tokens  fp8_ds_mla -> --kv-cache-memory-bytes 23622320128   (~22.0 GiB)
```

Their DSpark also runs **k=7 greedy**, against the k<=5 limit measured on the old
stack. Worth re-testing here, since native DSpark in this lineage may lift it.

---

## 6. Measured throughput (A, `fp8_ds_mla`, util 0.89, warm, 128 tok/req)

| concurrency | aggregate tok/s | per-stream |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 53.2 | 53.2 |
| 2 | 75.7 | 37.8 |
| 3 | 113.2 | 37.7 |
| 4 | 124.9 | 31.2 |
| **5** | **140.3** | 28.1 |
| 6 | 109.0 | 18.2 |

c6 aggregate falls *below* c3, so `max_num_seqs 6` is the saturation point. That
is acceptable for a 3-5 session target but marks the ceiling.

**This is below the old stage-c arena result (162.5 agg at c5).** The variables
differ (`max_num_seqs` 6 vs 12, k=5 vs k=3, abliterated vs base model, 1.65M vs
1.45M pool), so the gap is not yet attributed. Do not treat A as the throughput
optimum until the ablations in §7 are run.

---

## 7. Tuning sweep: `max_num_seqs` 6 is optimal

Every config below is the shipped recipe with one setting changed, booted from
scratch, warmed, then measured. Aggregate tok/s, 128 tok/req.

| config | slots (`seqs x (k+1)`) | KV tokens | c1 | c3 | c5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **`max_num_seqs` 6, k=5** | 36 | **1,663,439** | 51.2 | **105.6** | **140.2** |
| `max_num_seqs` 8, k=5 | 48 | 1,638,922 | 49.5 | 102.7 | 129.4 |
| `max_num_seqs` 12, k=5 | 72 | 1,635,809 | 53.6 | 92.9 | 124.0 |

Monotonic: **raising `max_num_seqs` costs both throughput and KV.** With only 5
live streams the extra slots are never filled, so they buy nothing while adding
scheduling overhead and taking memory from the pool. The c6 rolloff seen at
seqs 6 is therefore a *compute* limit, not a slot limit. Leave it at 6.

Reproducibility: `s6_k5` measured c5 = 140.3 / 135.0 / 140.2 across three
independent boots, so treat anything under ~5% as noise and weight c3/c5 over c1
(which swings 51-60).

### k is not tunable here

k=3 is rejected outright by this image:

```
DSpark requires num_speculative_tokens >= dspark_block_size (5); got 3
```

k must be **>= 5 and a multiple of 5**, so 5 and 10 are the only legal values.
This differs from stage-c, where k=3 was legal and measured 6.7% faster.

### Still untested

`draft_sample_method: greedy` (bjk110 ships greedy), k=10,
`max_num_batched_tokens`, `cudagraph_mode: FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, and the b12x flags
individually (`MHC`, `SPARSE_INDEXER`, `FP8_GEMM` all measured harmful on
stage-c; removing all three at once failed to boot, so they need one at a time).

---

## 8. SSD KV offload does NOT work on this image

**Tested and closed.** `OffloadingConnector` with a `fs_python` disk tier makes
the worker die during startup with:

```
RuntimeError: Worker failed with error 'CUDA error: an illegal memory access
was encountered'
```

Verified twice, so it is not a b12x interaction:

| attention backend | result |
|---|---|
| `B12X_MLA_SPARSE` | illegal memory access |
| default (FlashInfer SM120) | illegal memory access |

The config itself is correct: the flag renders properly, `/kvspill` is bound from
NVMe (ext4, 1.6 TB free), and `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` is set to
`garbage_collection_threshold:0.9` because offload connectors reject
`expandable_segments` outright.

**This is deliberately not worked around.** An illegal memory access means the KV
buffers the connector registers are not laid out the way the DeepSeek-V4 kernels
read them. The same class of bug can produce silently wrong tokens instead of a
crash, so forcing it would be worse than shipping without offload.
[`examples/eugr-prod-ssd.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/eugr-prod-ssd.yaml) is kept as a record
of the attempt.

Practical note: the 1.66M-token pool already holds ~1.6 full 1M-context sessions,
so offload would buy cross-session reuse rather than capacity that is currently
short.


---

## 9. Head-to-head: eugr fp8_ds_mla vs stage-c nvfp4_ds_mla

Both configurations serve. Both use the same abliterated model, DSpark k=5,
`max_num_seqs 6`, and b12x MoE. Measured warm, 128 tok/req.

| | eugr + `fp8_ds_mla` | stage-c + `nvfp4_ds_mla` |
|---|---:|---:|
| recipe | [`eugr-prod.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/eugr-prod.yaml) | [`stagec-nvfp4-prod.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/stagec-nvfp4-prod.yaml) |
| image | eugr nightly `2026081903`, stock | `bjk110/vllm-spark@sha256:d8492e76` + overlay |
| `gpu_memory_utilization` | 0.89 | 0.82 |
| **KV pool** | 1,674,044 | **2,198,373** (+31%) |
| c1 tok/s | **60.3** | 47.6 |
| c3 aggregate | **101.3** | 98.1 |
| **c5 aggregate** | **135.0** | 109.7 (-19%) |
| recipe size | **73 lines, 0 `pre_exec`** | 344 lines, 2 `pre_exec` |

**Choose by what is scarce.** NVFP4 buys 31% more KV and costs ~19% throughput at
c5. For 3-5 concurrent sessions that do not need enormous shared context, the
eugr config is faster and far simpler. When total context is the binding
constraint, stage-c is the only way past ~1.7M on this hardware.

### Getting stage-c to boot at all

Two stage-c recipes fail before the model ever loads, with

```
ValueError: Model architectures ['DeepseekV4ForCausalLM'] failed to be inspected
```

raised from a subprocess whose stderr vLLM discards. This is **not** the model
(the base `deepseek-ai` model fails identically, and both `config.json` files are
byte-identical), **not** the image (the prebuilt overlay image fails the same
way), and not a missing download. It is the `nvfp4-1m` recipe itself, which
carries env vars vLLM flags as unknown (`VLLM_SKIP_INIT_MEMORY_CHECK`,
`VLLM_TRITON_MLA_SPARSE`) and `mods` that do not resolve here.

The working route is to start from the arena-threshold recipe, which boots
reliably, and change only what the KV dtype requires: `nvfp4_ds_mla`,
`max_num_seqs 6`, k=5, util 0.82. KV dtype and seqs/k must move together, since
spec-decode buffers scale with `max_num_seqs x (k+1)`.
