# Golden deployment: anemll NVFP4, ~2.0M KV, 2x DGX Spark

The shipped configuration as of 2026-08-22. Every number below is measured on
this cluster with one harness, not quoted from upstream.

**Recipe:** [`examples/anemll-nvfp4-golden.yaml`](../../../configs/examples/anemll-nvfp4-golden.yaml)
· **Endpoint:** `http://192.168.0.211:8000/v1`
· **Model names:** `deepseek-v4-flash`, `dsv4`, or the full HF path

```bash
curl -s http://192.168.0.211:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":64}'
```

`--served-model-name` **replaces** the default name rather than adding to it, so
the full HF path is no longer accepted. `/v1/models` lists exactly
`deepseek-v4-flash` and `dsv4`. Any client still configured with
`drowzeys/keys-DeepSeekV4-Flash-GA-0731-Dspark-Abliterated-32-32` must be
updated. The upside is that swapping the underlying checkpoint later does not
force callers to change, since they bind to the alias.

```bash
bash ~/spark-launch.sh anemll-nvfp4.yaml ~/anemll.log
curl -s localhost:8000/health                       # 200
```

## 1. What it is

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| container | `ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1` | the only image tested that delivers **real** NVFP4 KV compression |
| model | `drowzeys/keys-DeepSeekV4-Flash-GA-0731-Dspark-Abliterated-32-32` | abliterated, DSpark draft head bundled |
| `kv_cache_dtype` | **`nvfp4_ds_mla`** | 7,650 B/token, 32% cheaper than fp8_ds_mla (§3) |
| `gpu_memory_utilization` | **0.82** | measured ceiling: 0.835 allocates 2,227,486 then dies in FlashInfer autotune (§4) |
| `max_num_seqs` | 6 | 5 concurrent clients plus headroom |
| `num_speculative_tokens` | 5 (DSpark) | k=5 is the floor this family accepts |
| `max_cudagraph_capture_size` | 36 | exactly `max_num_seqs x (k+1)`; nothing reachable is dropped |
| `max_model_len` | 1,048,576 | full 1M context |
| patches | **none** | stock image |
| tool calling | `--tool-call-parser deepseek_v4 --enable-auto-tool-choice` | verified with a live `tool_choice: auto` request |
| reasoning | `--reasoning-parser deepseek_v4` | same parser family |
| tokenizer | `--tokenizer-mode deepseek_v4` | the parsers depend on model-specific chat-template tokenization; `auto` makes them unreliable rather than absent |

> **Diff feature flags, not just performance, when switching recipes.** Moving
> from `eugr-prod.yaml` to this one silently dropped tool calling and reasoning
> parsing, which surfaced only as a client-side
> `400 "auto" tool choice requires --enable-auto-tool-choice`. Capacity and
> throughput were compared carefully; the feature flags were not.

## 2. Measured, three lineages, one harness

Warm, 128 tok/req, single shared coding prompt at temperature 0.7, aggregate
tok/s. Prompt choice matters enormously here: see §5.

| | **anemll (shipped)** | eugr + PIECEWISE | stage-c (tonyd2wild) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| KV pool | **1,971,682 - 2,002,497** | 1,659,937 - 1,768,024 | 1,438,916 |
| bytes/token | **7,650** | 11,317 | ~11,900 |
| max concurrency @ 1M | **1.91x** | 1.58x | 1.37x |
| c1 | 51.4 | 54.3 | **56.1** |
| c3 | **112.7** | 90.3 | 93.5 |
| c5 | 126.2 | **127.4** | 116.0 |
| c6 | **157.9** | ~109 | 141.1 |
| vLLM | 0.25.2 (Jul) | 0.27.x (Aug) | 0.21.1rc1 |

anemll wins on capacity (+13% over eugr, +39% over stage-c) and on multi-client
throughput (c3 +25%, c6 +45%). It gives up ~5% at c1, which is the least
relevant case for a 5-client workload.

**The KV pool varies ~1.5% between boots of an identical recipe** (measured
2,002,497 and 1,971,682). vLLM derives it from free memory observed during
profiling, so page cache and whatever else is resident at that moment move it.
Treat the range as normal and do not read a lower number after a restart as a
regression.

## 3. The NVFP4 saving is real here, and only here

**7,650 bytes/token against fp8_ds_mla's 11,317, a 32% reduction.** This is the
only authentic NVFP4 KV saving found across three lineages:

- Our own NVFP4 patch on the eugr image appeared to give 22%. It did not. One KV
  group was sized with a 432-byte page while the writer emitted 584, a 26%
  **under**-allocation. Direct measurement puts fp8 at 9,094 B/token and
  nvfp4_ds_mla at 9,083, i.e. identical. See
  [vllm-spark-nvfp4/EUGR_NVFP4.md](../nvfp4/EUGR_NVFP4.md).
- stage-c is labelled NVFP4 and measures ~11,900 B/token, barely different from
  fp8.

anemll's image was built around the format rather than retrofitted with it,
which is the difference.

## 4. The utilization ceiling is 0.82, and 0.835 fails specifically

| util | KV pool | outcome |
|---|---:|---|
| 0.835 (MiaAI-Lab's value) | 2,227,486 | allocates, worker SIGKILLed during **FlashInfer sparse-MLA autotune** |
| **0.82** | **1,971,682 - 2,002,497** | **serves** |

The failure is not graph capture and not the arena. It is FlashInfer's
autotuning step allocating workspaces on top of a 16.25 GiB arena. The eugr
image skips that step entirely (`Skipping FlashInfer autotune because no
FlashInfer...`), which is part of why it tolerates a higher utilization.

There is no env var to disable it in this image; only
`VLLM_FLASHINFER_AUTOTUNE_CACHE_DIR`, which would need a pre-warmed cache.
Anyone wanting MiaAI-Lab's 2.49M should start by warming that cache.

## 5. Throughput is workload-dependent, by a factor of ~1.7

Measured on the same server, same config, differing only in prompts:

| harness | c5 aggregate |
|---|---:|
| one shared coding prompt, natural EOS, temp 0.7 | **141 tok/s** |
| unique generic prose prompts, `ignore_eos` forced | **81 tok/s** |

Two effects compound: unique prompts defeat prefix-cache sharing across the five
streams, and forced continuation past natural EOS collapses DSpark draft
acceptance (code is where the draft head predicts well). Quote a tok/s number
for this stack only alongside the prompt shape that produced it.

## 6. Operating notes

- **`/health` is not a liveness check.** It only proves the API server is up. A
  hung worker leaves it returning 200 while generation blocks indefinitely. Use a
  tiny generation request instead. The early warning in the log is
  `No available shared memory broadcast block`, repeated.
- **`docker rm -f` does not release memory from a wedged vLLM container.**
  `pkill -9 -f 'VLLM::'` does, and recovers a node from 118-123 GiB used back to
  ~4 GiB without a reboot. Always confirm both nodes are under ~10 GiB used
  before launching; four runs were once wasted on a node that never released
  memory from the previous failure.
- **Launch only via `spark-launch.sh`**, which tears down both nodes, sweeps
  `/dev/shm`, drops page cache and refuses configs that exceed physical memory.
- Boot takes ~8-10 minutes. `stall: 1` during startup is usually transient;
  three or more means the worker is gone.

## 7. What this does not do

**~2.5M KV: not reached.** 2.0M is 80% of the target. The ceiling is FlashInfer
autotune at util 0.835, and above that the constraint is 81.34 GiB of weights
leaving ~30 GiB for arena, workspaces and graphs. Details in
[KV_CEILING.md](KV_CEILING.md).

**SSD offload: does not work for this model.** Built and tested end to end on the
eugr image with the `fs` tier on NVMe. Faults with `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`
under both `fp8_ds_mla` and flat `fp8`, because vLLM's offload transfer path
assumes a single flat layout while DeepSeek-V4 builds a hybrid multi-group cache.
Full test in
[vllm-spark-nvfp4/KV_OFFLOAD_MLA.md](../nvfp4/KV_OFFLOAD_MLA.md).

**Rollback:** `bash ~/spark-launch.sh eugr-prod.yaml ~/PROD.log` gives 1,768,024
tokens on vLLM 0.27.x, five weeks newer, at the cost of 13% capacity and 45% of
c6 throughput.

**Re-boot via `05-serve.sh golden` does NOT reproduce this deployment
(2026-08-26).** The serve-script path (pin.golden.env) feeds the **vanilla**
`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` checkpoint and the node's
`/models/ds4-flash-0731` dir; this recipe is the **abliterated** model
deployed through `spark-launch.sh anemll-nvfp4.yaml`. Attempts fail:
(a) vLLM 0.25.2 dies on empty `VLLM_USE_B12X_MOE` (`int('')`) — the serve
script passes it empty unless pinned (pin.golden.env now pins the B12X_*
vars to 0); (b) with the vanilla checkpoint, `profile_run` hits the
fp8_einsum `layout.hpp:97` scale assert (the same ue8m0 recipe family fixed
for vLLM main in vllm-project/vllm#53521). To reproduce the golden numbers,
use the abliterated model + `spark-launch.sh` as originally done.
