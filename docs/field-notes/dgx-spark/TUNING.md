# Tuning, what moves the needle (and what doesn't)

Measured on 2× GB10, tonyd2wild `dspark-nvfp4-stage-c`, `deepseek-ai`/`apetersson` FP8, 1M ctx,
NVFP4 KV, DSpark k=5. See [scripts/bench.py](../../../scripts/bench.py) to reproduce.

## The one real lever: `gpu-memory-utilization` → KV pool size

Weights are fixed (~167 GB / ~83.5 GB per node). Everything above that becomes KV pool. Since the
weights sit just under the budget, small util bumps produce large pool changes, and this is the lever
that matters for **concurrent large coding sessions** (200-500K tokens each).

| util | KV pool (tokens) | concurrency @ 1M | startup | verdict |
|------|-----------------:|-----------------:|---------|---------|
| 0.78 | 1,181,262 | 1.13× | fast (~3 min) | too tight for 3 large sessions |
| 0.80 | ~1.65–1.87M | ~1.6–1.8× | fast | good |
| **0.82** | **2,137,521** | **2.04×** | **fast (~4 min)** | **recommended, big pool, fast startup** |
| 0.85 | 2,769,487 | 2.64× | **~11+ min, stalls** | ❌ pool quantization/graph setup pathologically slow at startup |

**The 0.85 cliff:** the NVFP4 KV pool at 2.77M tokens takes 11+ min to quantize/capture at startup
(one rank pinned at GPU 96% on "kv cache quantization", the other waiting on `shm_broadcast`), which
makes every restart painful. **0.82 is the practical ceiling**: nearly the capacity, none of the
startup pain. Push toward 0.85 only if you (a) rarely restart and (b) can eat the ~11-min cold start.

Pool math for your workload: at util 0.82 (~2M tokens), 2-3 concurrent coding sessions of ~500-650K
each fit; sessions approaching a full 1M each will contend past ~2 concurrent (that's the `nvfp4_ds_mla`
+ `gpu-memory-utilization` ceiling, the only way past it on this hardware is expert-pruned weights,
see MODEL_VARIANTS REAP, or LMCache disk-spill, see UPSTREAM_GAPS #7).

## `max-num-seqs` → aggregate throughput (the real throughput lever, measured 2026-08)

The recipe ships `max-num-seqs 6`, tuned for a few large coding sessions. That value **caps aggregate
throughput**: the batch fills at c6 and queues beyond it. Raising it (util **0.82**, nvfp4 1M KV,
DSpark, coding prompt) scales aggregate ~linearly and **costs nothing at low concurrency** (single-stream
c1 is unchanged, ~53-62 tok/s):

| max-num-seqs | peak aggregate | at | single-stream (c1) | boots? |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| 6 | 159 tok/s | c6 | ~55 | ✅ |
| 16 | 293 tok/s | c16 | ~58 | ✅ |
| **32** | **421 tok/s** | **c32** | ~53 | ✅ (cudagraph capture ~55s, ~7 min warm start) |
| 48 |, |, |, | ❌ **hangs** at API-server handoff (`shm_broadcast` 60s stall; 48-seq cudagraph capture wedges the multi-node frontend) |

**`max-num-seqs 32` is the recommended setting** and strictly dominates 6: identical behavior when only
2-3 requests are active (KV is allocated per-*active*-request from the shared pool, not pre-reserved per
slot), but a **2.6× higher aggregate ceiling (159 → 421 tok/s)** under load. This **beats the old FP8
throughput-mode number (326 tok/s @ c48 on eugr-b12x)** while keeping nvfp4 **1M context + DSpark + full
per-stream speed**: so there is no longer a reason to switch to the FP8/no-spec image just for aggregate
throughput. **48 is the boot ceiling** on this 2× GB10 multi-node setup (frontend hang), so stay at 32.

## Single-stream decode: already at the ceiling (don't bother tuning)

The recipe author's exhaustive sweep + our re-check: **zero config wins.** Proven negatives, do not
re-test:

| lever | result |
|---|---|
| `num_speculative_tokens` (k) | **locked at 5**: 7 rejected at boot (must be multiple of n_predict=5), 10 crashes at runtime |
| `max-model-len` 1M → 200K | no gain |
| `max-num-seqs` 6 → 2 | no gain *for single-stream* (but it IS the aggregate-throughput lever, see next section) |
| `--max-cudagraph-capture-size 36` | no gain |
| util (for *speed*) | no effect (only changes pool size) |

Decode is **acceptance-driven**, and acceptance is **content-driven**: the same server does ~83 tok/s
on counting and ~64 on a BST implementation. Any single number without the workload is meaningless.

## What content does to DSpark (measured)

| content | mean accepted length | draft acceptance | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| code (BST, functions) | **4.26** | ~65% | fast, coding agents win big |
| math (primality) | ~2.4 | ~28% | slower |

Coding is predictable → speculation flies. This is why an agentic coding client is the best-case
workload for this serve.

## Concurrency (your 2-3 chat load), coding prompt

| concurrency | per-stream tok/s (util 0.78) | per-stream tok/s (util 0.82, settled) |
|---|---|---|
| c1 | 41.2 | 53.7 |
| c2 | 39.5 | 44.5 |
| **c3** | **37.1** | **40.5** |
| c6 | 14.8 | 25.9 |

Per-stream barely drops c1→c3: your 2-3 concurrent coding chats each stay near single-stream speed.
util changes KV pool size, not decode speed, the spread between the two columns is run-to-run
acceptance variance (content-driven), not a util effect. It only collapses once you fill the batch
(c6 with seqs 6).

## Load time (subsequent restarts)

VRAM does not survive process exit (CUDA context destroyed), every restart reloads weights. But:
- **Warm reload weight read ≈ 36 s** (OS page cache hot), vs ~4 min cold first load.
- The **compile/capture cache persists** (`VLLM_CACHE_ROOT`) → "Directly load AOT compilation from
  cache"; the torch.compile phase is already fast on restart.
- `fastsafetensors` (0.3.2, present) could parallelize the FP8 unpack, the recipe uses plain
  `safetensors`; marginal on warm reloads, bigger on cold.
- Net: warm restarts are dominated by warmup + KV-pool setup, not the weight read, and KV-pool setup
  is exactly what balloons at util 0.85 (the cliff above).

## Recommended config

```
--gpu-memory-utilization 0.82        # big KV pool, fast startup (not 0.85, startup cliff)
--max-num-seqs 32                    # aggregate-throughput lever: 6→32 = 159→421 tok/s peak, free at low-c (48 hangs)
--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla        # the 1M enabler
--max-model-len 1048576
--speculative-config '{"method":"dspark","num_speculative_tokens":5,"draft_sample_method":"probabilistic"}'
```

Clock capped 2200 MHz (free, bandwidth-bound). For pure many-user throughput at ≤512K instead of 1M,
use the eugr-b12x FP8 no-spec path (326 tok/s @ c48), different image, different tradeoff.

## fp8 vs nvfp4_ds_mla KV, measured head-to-head (2026-08-21)

Both booted on the **same** recipe (`deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-arena-threshold`,
util **0.78**, `max-num-seqs 12`, DSpark **k=3**), changing only `kv_cache_dtype`.
Measured warm via `/v1/completions` with `ignore_eos:true`, 128 tokens/request.

| `kv_cache_dtype` | KV pool | tokens | bytes/token | c1 tok/s | c5 aggregate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `fp8` | 12.27 GiB | **1,448,712** | ~9,094 | **58.3** | **162.5** |
| `nvfp4_ds_mla` | 11.46 GiB | 1,354,614 | ~9,083 | 51.1 | 159.2 |

**At this util/seqs combination NVFP4 KV is not a win**: near-identical bytes/token
(~9.1 KB), *fewer* total tokens (less memory left available), and ~12% slower
single-stream.

**Do not read this as "NVFP4 KV is worse."** The large NVFP4 pools documented above
(2.14M @ util 0.82, 2.77M @ util 0.85, allocated but not served) come from the **1M recipe**, which pairs
NVFP4 KV with `max-num-seqs 6` and `k=5`. Spec-decode buffers scale with
`max_num_seqs × (k+1)`, so at `max-num-seqs 12` those buffers consume the memory that
should have become KV. The KV dtype and the seqs/k choice have to be tuned together , 
changing one alone gives a misleading result (this table is exactly that mistake,
kept here as the control).

## Aggregate throughput at low concurrency (2026-08-21)

Production config (`arena-threshold`: fp8 KV, util 0.78, `max-num-seqs 12`, k=3),
warm, `ignore_eos:true`, 128 tokens/request:

| concurrency | aggregate tok/s | per-request tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 58.3 | 58.3 |
| 5 | **162.5** | ~32.5 |

Consistent with the `max-num-seqs` table above (seqs 6 → 159 tok/s at c6), and with an
independent community GB10 measurement of 61.5 tok/s single-stream text-only. For
higher aggregate, raise `max-num-seqs`: it scales roughly linearly and costs nothing
at c1.

## b12x sub-feature flags (2026-08-20), all measured, none adopted

The stage-c image exposes more b12x toggles than the recipe enables. Tested on the
arena-threshold config; baseline 28-cell grid mean **53.57**, official arena decode
raw mean **44.75**.

| Flag | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_MOE=1` | already on in the shipped recipe | **keep** |
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1` | already on | **keep** |
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_MHC=1` | +1.9% local (inside noise); **official arena raw 37.95 vs 44.75** | reject, officially worse |
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_SPARSE_INDEXER=1` | −2.6%; collapses deep-context cells (the Lightning Indexer does most of its work at long context) | reject |
| `VLLM_USE_B12X_FP8_GEMM=1` | **crash**: `DeepGEMM/csrc/.../utils/layout.hpp:39: t.dim() == N` | reject |
| `VLLM_DSV4_B12X_COMPRESSED_MLA` | left at `0` in the recipe; same kernel family that hangs under the eugr b12x image | leave off |

Also measured and rejected:

| Change | Result |
|---|---|
| `num_speculative_tokens` 3 → 5 *(on the arena-threshold config)* | **−6.7%** (49.99 vs 53.57). Note the 1M recipe uses k=5 deliberately, k must be a multiple of `n_predict=5`, and it pairs with `max-num-seqs 6`. |
| `long_prefill_token_threshold` 1024 → 4096 | neutral |
| `--load-format fastsafetensors` | load ~3× faster (60 s vs 3m17s) but **OOM-kills the worker** on unified memory, unusable |
