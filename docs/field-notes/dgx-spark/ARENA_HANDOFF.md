# Spark Arena Leaderboard Push, Handoff

Status doc for resuming the arena leaderboard work on 2x DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121a).
Last updated: 2026-08-20.

## READ THIS FIRST (2026-08-20): systemd RemoveIPC invalidated many earlier conclusions

**Root cause found for the "flaky 2-node rendezvous" that plagued this entire effort.**
Both nodes had the systemd default `RemoveIPC=yes` in logind.conf with `Linger=no`.
The worker node (spark2) is started over SSH; when that login session closed,
systemd-logind DELETED all POSIX semaphores owned by maci, including the ones vLLM's
MultiprocExecutor created. The worker then died with:

```
File ".../multiprocessing/synchronize.py", line 115, in __setstate__
    self._semlock = _multiprocessing.SemLock._rebuild(*state)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

The head node does NOT error when this happens: it blocks forever on the next collective.
That produced symptoms I repeatedly misdiagnosed as b12x kernel deadlocks:
`shm_broadcast ... no block found in 60 seconds`, GPU pinned at 96% with no progress,
freeze at `Capturing CUDA graphs (FULL): 2/10`, and `DistStoreError: 1/2 clients joined`.
**The tell I missed: the worker container was up but had NO `Worker_TP` process at all.**
"Worker idle" actually meant "worker dead".

**FIX (applied 2026-08-20, persists across reboots, no sudo needed):**
```
loginctl enable-linger maci     # on BOTH nodes
```
Verify with `loginctl show-user maci | grep Linger` -> must be `Linger=yes`.

**Consequences for this document:** every section below dated before 2026-08-20 that
reports a 2-node hang, "deadlock", DistStoreError, or "rendezvous flake" is SUSPECT and
may simply be this bug. In particular the claims that the b12x FULL-cudagraph-capture
deadlocks and that "no image can beat the record because 2-node collectives deadlock"
are WRONG as stated. After the fix, b12x clears FULL cudagraph capture 100% in 20s.
Hard errors (v027 sparse-MLA kernel error, v023 checkpoint key mismatch) are unaffected
and still valid, as are any measured benchmark numbers from configs that actually served.

## Post-fix results (2026-08-20), all measured with linger fixed

Baseline for comparison: record config (k=3), 28-cell grid (ctx 0-100k x concurrency
1/2/5/10, tg128 aggregate) = **mean 53.57**. Raw grid in `~/dspark_grid.txt`.

| Change tested | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `num_speculative_tokens: 5` | 28-cell mean **49.99** (-6.7%) | REJECTED. Stable, never crashed, but worse. Wins at c5/c10 short-ctx (c10 ctx0: 167.9 vs 155.2), collapses at c1 deep-ctx (1.5 tok/s @100k). The recipe comment "k=5 is ~24% faster" is true only for short-context single-stream, NOT the arena profile. Grid in `~/k5_grid.txt`. |
| `--load-format fastsafetensors` | worker `Killed` (kernel OOM) | REJECTED. Load is ~3x faster (24 shards @2.4s/it ~60s vs 48 shards @3m17s) but on GB10's 121GB UNIFIED memory (GPU+host share one pool) its parallel pinned-memory loading OOMs the worker. `runai_streamer` is not installed in the stage-c image. |
| b12x + DSpark spec (Aug19) | hangs pre-serve | Real bug (not linger). Both workers ALIVE ~29% CPU, symmetric, `futex_do_wait`+`ib_uverbs_event_read`, GPUs 0%, no cache writes, no compiler procs. Never prints `Starting vLLM server`. Warmup ruled out (`enable_jit_warmup`/`enable_cutedsl_warmup`/`enable_flashinfer_autotune` all False -> identical hang). |
| b12x no-spec (Aug19) | serves, then inference hangs | Real bug. `Starting vLLM server` + `/health` 200 (on port **8000**, not 8888), but first trivial request (`1+1=`, max_tokens 8) never returns after 11+ min, GPU spinning 96%, zero new log lines. |

**Conclusion: b12x still cannot serve inference on this cluster, but for genuine reasons
now, and the failure is localized (spec -> pre-serve hang; no-spec -> inference hang).**
The record recipe (k=3, default loader) remains the best config at 53.57.

Upstream issue (corrected + narrowed): https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker/issues/352
The original capture-deadlock claim was retracted there; #335 (DistStoreError 1/2 clients)
may have the same linger root cause and was flagged.

Useful recipes on spark1 `~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/`: `dspark-k5.yaml`, `dspark-fastload.yaml`,
`eugr19-ns.yaml` (no-spec), `eugr19-nowarmup.yaml`, `eugr13-dspark.yaml` (Aug13 build).
Benchmark runners: `~/k5_grid.sh`, `~/sweepbench8888.py` (port-8888 variant of sweepbench).

## TL;DR

- **Production serve works and is fast**: ~567 tok/s aggregate at concurrency 32
  (short context), 24-44 tok/s single stream. Restored and healthy on
  `spark1:8000` (nvfp4 + DSpark, 1M context, standard vLLM backends).
- **Two completing arena submissions on the leaderboard**: fp8-vanilla (~28) and
  nvfp4 (~25). These are the reliable ceiling with the standard kernels.
- **The b12x fast-kernel path is exhausted / broken** on this box's current
  nightly (details below). It was the only route to materially higher arena
  numbers.
- **Current task**: hyperparameter sweep at the arena's concurrency levels
  (1/2/5/10) on the least-hacky high-perf image, to push the completing-config
  score as high as possible. See "Sweep plan".

## Hardware / cluster

- 2x DGX Spark (GB10, unified memory ~121 GB usable each, sm_121a).
- sparkrun cluster `spark`: hosts `[spark1, spark2]`, `transfer_interface: mgmt`
  (the Spark-link 10.0.x interface has a broken SSH key-exchange; always use mgmt).
- Clock cap 2200 MHz persisted via privileged container `gb10-clockcap` on both
  nodes (`nvidia-smi -lgc 0,2200` loop, `--restart unless-stopped`). Survives reboot.
- Config: `/home/maci/.config/sparkrun/clusters/spark.yaml`.

## Perf numbers (measured 2026-08-15, production nvfp4+DSpark)

| Workload | tok/s |
|---|---|
| Single-stream, general decode | ~24 |
| Single-stream, code gen (DSpark ~2x) | ~44 |
| Concurrency 5, short ctx | ~141 aggregate |
| Concurrency 16, short ctx | ~262 aggregate |
| Concurrency 32 (full batch), short ctx | ~567 aggregate |

Note: the arena caps concurrency at 10 and runs at 8K-100K depths, so it never
reaches the 567 peak. Arena score reflects deep-context x low-concurrency, a
fundamentally slower regime.

## Arena benchmark profile (what we're scored on)

`@official/spark-arena-v2`: pp[2048] x tg[128] x depth[0, 4096, 8192, 16384,
32768, 65535, 100000] x concurrency[1, 2, 5, 10], 3 runs = 28 tasks.
Runner: `uvx llama-benchy@0.4.0`. Submit via `uvx sparkrun arena benchmark run`.

## UPDATE: a working b12x tag exists, Aug13 (2026081302)
The ~28 submission (`sub1786675482641`) used **b12x tag `2026081302` (Aug13),
NO DSpark (b12x-no-spec, fp8 KV, ray backend, safetensors), seqs=48**. That's why
it completed, no DSpark = no `sample_tokens` deadlock. My "b12x exhausted" work
below was on `:latest` (Aug14, cudagraph-hang regression) and Aug10 (hung). **Aug13
no-spec works.** The saved recipe is in `~/.cache/sparkrun/benchmarks/sub1786675482641/recipe.yaml`.

**Submission in progress (2026-08-15):** retuned that recipe to **seqs=12** (from 48
,  sweep showed 48 wastes KV at the arena's c10 cap) → `~/b12x_tuned.yaml`, running
`sparkrun arena benchmark run ~/b12x_tuned.yaml --cluster spark` (log `~/arena_submit.log`).
Fast kernels + sweep insight → target > 28. If it beats the old ~28, that's the climb.

**RESULT, SUBMITTED `sub1786864624365`, BEATS the old ~28.** Full 28-task run
completed (no crashes). Per-cell decode (tg128) head-to-head vs the ~28
(`sub1786675482641`, seqs=48): **mine wins 24/28 cells**, ~11% higher aggregate on
the 24 comparable cells (694 vs 628). Big wins at mid depths (65535×c2: 36.1 vs 6.1;
16384×c5: 49.1 vs 33.0; 8192×c10: 60.1 vs 54.6). Deep 100K×c5/c10 crater in BOTH
(~2.7-3.1 tok/s), inherent to batched=16384 chunked-prefill starving decode, NOT a
differentiator. The seqs=12 sweep insight transferred cleanly to b12x. Exact
leaderboard score is server-side (SPA, no fetchable API found, check
spark-arena.com leaderboard in a browser).

**Next tuning lever (bigger than seqs):** the deep×concurrent cells crater because
`max_num_batched_tokens=16384` chunked prefill starves decode. Try LOWERING it (e.g.
2048-4096) or disabling chunked prefill for the deep cells, could lift the 100K/65K
c5/c10 cells from ~3 to much higher and materially raise the score. Test on Aug13
(or the Aug15 tag).

## BEST CONFIG (2026-08-18): Aug15 tag + seqs=12 + batched=8192
Phase A (batched sweep on Aug13) + Phase B (Aug15 tag) results, at the cratered
probe cells (local sweepbench, decode tok/s):

| cell | ~28 base (48/16384) | Aug13 seqs12/16384 (submitted) | Aug13 8192 | **Aug15 8192** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8192 c10  | 60.1 | 60.1 | 68.0 | **91.0** |
| 16384 c10 | 15.0 | 15.0 | 77.1 | **93.3** |
| 32768 c5  | 12.4 | 12.4 | 40.9 | **57.1** |
| 32768 c10 | 8.1  | 8.1  | 89.5 | **96.9** |
| 65535 c5  | 4.9  | 4.9  | 35.1 | **39.1** |

- **batched 16384->8192** fixes chunked-prefill-starving-decode (2048/4096/8192 all
  ~tied, all crush 16384; picked 8192 for prefill safety).
- **Aug13->Aug15** (`2026081502`) wins every cell AND boots clean (Aug14 `:latest`
  had the cudagraph-hang regression; Aug15 fixed it). Aug15 is the newest tag
  (nightly paused after Aug15). Recipe: `~/b12x_aug15.yaml`.
- **SUBMITTED `sub1786984071986`** (Aug15 + seqs=12 + batched=8192). Beats prior
  `sub1786864624365` (Aug13/16384) by **+14% aggregate decode** (791 vs 694 tg-sum).
  Cratered cells recovered: 16384c10 15->63, 32768c5 12->48, 100000c2 4.8->32.
  Small dip at shallow c1/c2 (~1-4 tok/s, smaller prefill chunks), net strongly +.
  Very deepest concurrent (100K c5/c10, 65K c10) stay ~3-5 (KV-bound: only ~4 of 10
  100K-contexts fit at gpu_util=0.86 fp8).

## Climb summary (best -> submit chain)
| submission | config | vs prior |
|---|---|---|
| ~28 baseline | seqs=48, batched=16384, Aug13 | leaderboard ref |
| `sub1786864624365` | seqs=12 | +11% (24/28 cells) |
| `sub1786984071986` | + batched=8192 + Aug15 tag | +14% decode (BEST) |

Net ~25%+ over the original ~28 baseline on aggregate decode. Check actual leaderboard
rank at spark-arena.com (score is server-side, no fetchable API).

## TOP LEADERBOARD RECIPE (adopt this), `anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1`
The current #1 uses a DIFFERENT, purpose-built image (not eugr-b12x). Recipe saved at
`~/anemll_top.yaml`. Why it wins vs our eugr path:
- **`mods: []`**: DSpark draft-loader baked in, NO pre_exec hook / trust gate.
- **DSpark WORKS** on it (fixes the `sample_tokens` deadlock that broke eugr DSpark) , 
  DSpark ~2x decode on the healthy cells.
- **`--no-scheduler-reserve-full-isl`**: scheduler doesn't reserve full input-seq-len
  KV up front → more requests fit at deep context → fixes our deep-cell cratering
  (our 100K×c10 = ~3 tok/s problem).
- **`--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla`** (not fp8) → ~2x KV capacity.
- **`--moe-backend flashinfer_b12x` + `--attention-backend FLASHINFER_MLA_SPARSE_DSV4`**
  (flashinfer kernels, different from B12X_MLA_SPARSE).
- DSpark **spec=3**, `max_model_len=524288`, seqs=64, batched=12288,
  env `DG_JIT_USE_NVRTC=0 VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1 VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=0`,
  `--load-format auto`, `--generation-config vllm`, `--enable-flashinfer-autotune`.
- Testing/adopting 2026-08-18: pulled image, `~/anemll_test.sh` validates probe cells,
  then submit. To BEAT it, layer our batched/gpu_util insights on top.

### Getting the anemll image to run via sparkrun (gotchas, SOLVED)
1. **No `ray` in the image**: recipe says `--distributed-executor-backend ray` but the
   image has no ray module/CLI. Fix: change to `--distributed-executor-backend mp` so
   sparkrun picks the **vllm-distributed** runtime (native --nnodes multi-node, no ray).
   (Aligns with "use vllm-distributed for everything.")
2. **`ENTRYPOINT [vllm serve]`**: sparkrun appends its own command (serve or the
   base64 `printf|bash` keepalive) to the entrypoint, so `vllm serve` swallowed it and
   args misaligned (`--compilation-config` got `'printf %s ...|bash'` → json_invalid).
   Fix: derived image **`anemll-noentry:latest`** (`FROM anemll...; ENTRYPOINT []`),
   built on BOTH nodes (identical image IDs → distribution skips). Recipe container set
   to `anemll-noentry:latest`. `~/anemll_top.yaml`, `~/Dockerfile.anemll`.
3. After both fixes it launches via vllm-distributed, loads main + DSpark draft models,
   and JIT-compiles FlashInfer/b12x/TileLang kernels (SLOW first time ~15-20min, cached
   after). Recipe now `recipe_version: '2'`.
4. **DO NOT single-node probe the full model**: TP=1 tries to load ~156GB on a 121GB
   node → OOM-thrashes the box for ~10min (sshd unresponsive). 2-node (78GB/node) is fine.

### BLOCKER (unresolved): anemll kernel JIT HANGS on our GB10
After both launch fixes, the anemll image loads both models fine but then **hangs
in TileLang JIT** compiling its FlashInfer sparse-MLA / b12x kernels: GPU pins 96%,
the compile log freezes (last line `[TileLang:tilelang.jit.kernel]`), kernel-artifact
creation stalls, and it never reaches health (waited 25-60min). Removing
`--enable-flashinfer-autotune` did NOT help (the TileLang JIT itself stalls, not just
the flashinfer autotune). The worker process is `R` (killable, not D-state) but holds
~100GB + GPU until killed. The #1 submitter ran this exact image on 2x GB10, so it CAN
work, this looks like a **toolchain/firmware mismatch** (TileLang/nvcc/driver version
vs theirs) we couldn't compile past. Untried ideas: `DG_JIT_USE_NVRTC=1` (recipe sets
0), a persistent/pre-warmed TileLang cache mounted into the container, a different
anemll tag, or asking the author what driver/JIT setup they used.

## DSpark on the WORKING eugr image, also blocked (2026-08-18)
Tried eugr b12x **Aug15 + DSpark** (official b12x-dspark recipe → Aug15 tag, seqs=12,
batched=8192, the draft-loader hook + `--speculative-config`). It loads main+draft
models and compiles (no TileLang hang, b12x kernels), BUT **hangs in cudagraph
capture** during warmup: 39min+ still "Capturing CUDA graphs (PIECEWISE): 100%"
cycling, no `init engine`/`Application startup`, GPU pinned 96%, never healthy.
So DSpark fails THREE distinct ways on our GB10:
- anemll image → TileLang JIT hang (never compiles)
- eugr Aug15 → cudagraph-capture warmup hang (never healthy)
- eugr :latest → reaches health, then `sample_tokens` RPC deadlock at concurrency
DSpark (the ~2x decode lever) is effectively **unusable for the arena on our setup**.
Even if warmup finished, ~20-40min per serve would likely exceed the arena's own
serve health-wait. Root cause is almost certainly a driver/firmware/toolchain mismatch
vs the setups where DSpark + these images work.

## Research: working DSpark setups + the NCCL requirement (2026-08-18)
The #1 anemll image (`ghcr.io/anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10:0.1.1`) is documented in:
- **MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark** (uses this exact image; requires
  `NCCL_IB_HCA`, `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`, `VLLM_HOST_IP`, `WORKER_VLLM_HOST_IP`,
  `MASTER_ADDR`, matching `TP_`/`GLOO_` IF names)
- **hazyumps/deepseek-v4-flash-gb10** (working DSpark, NCCL 2.30.4/RDMA, 40-60 tok/s decode)
- anemll on X (status 2077271758768583051): vLLM 0.25.1 overlay; notes the sparse-MLA
  warmup is gated to backends that EXCLUDE GB10's SPARSE_MLA_SM120, so kernels JIT
  mid-inference, anemll's overlay warms them at startup instead.

**Our RoCE hardware matches MiaAI-Lab exactly**: HCA `rocep1s0f1`, fabric iface
`enp1s0f1np1` (10.0.1.1 head / 10.0.1.2 worker). Added `NCCL_IB_HCA=rocep1s0f1` +
`NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=enp1s0f1np1` to `~/anemll_top.yaml` env. **It did NOT fix the
TileLang JIT hang**: rank-0 (spark1) still spins compiling TileLang (GPU 96%, CPU 88%,
cache static, log frozen), rank-1 (spark2) idle. Since the eugr B12X image reaches
health on this SAME sparkrun networking (our +25% submission), the hang is
**image/toolchain-specific (TileLang 0.1.9 on our GB10), not a networking gap**.
Remaining untried (need author input): match their exact **driver/firmware** (ours:
580.173.02, CUDA 13.0) and/or **TileLang build**; try `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME`/`TP_SOCKET_IFNAME`
+ fabric `VLLM_HOST_IP` (low odds since eugr works without them); or get a pre-warmed
TileLang kernel cache from a working node and mount it.

## OUTCOME (2026-08-18)
- **BEST SUBMISSION: `sub1786984071986`** (eugr b12x Aug15 + seqs=12 + batched=8192),
  ~25% over the ~28 baseline on aggregate decode. This stands.
- The #1 recipe's **anemll image is blocked on our GB10 by the TileLang JIT hang**
  (above). Its config insights (`--no-scheduler-reserve-full-isl`, nvfp4 KV, DSpark
  spec=3, flashinfer backends) are anemll-image-specific flags that DON'T exist in the
  eugr b12x image, so they can't be ported without that image working.
- Box left clean (both nodes, GPU freed). Derived image `anemll-noentry:latest` kept
  on both nodes for future retry.

## Remaining levers (if pushing further)
- **gpu_util** for the deepest cells: 100K×c10 is KV-bound (4/10 fit). Higher gpu_util
  = more KV = more of the 10 fit = better. But nvfp4 hung at 0.86 (b12x fp8 ran 0.86
  fine); try 0.88-0.90 on b12x, watch for OOM/hang.
- **batched even lower** (2048/4096) ~tied with 8192 on decode but slower prefill;
  8192 chosen as the balance. Re-check if arena weights prefill (pp) heavily.
- Trade: batched=8192 slows deep prefill a lot (Task 28 100K×c10 took ~30min). If the
  arena penalizes wall-time/pp, a middle batched (12288) might balance better.

**NEXT after this lands: test Aug15 tags** `20260815` / `2026081502` (appeared 2026-08-15,
newer than the Aug14 `:latest` that regressed). If fixed, they're the cleanest path
(official image, NO sparkrun patches needed, and may re-enable DSpark for a higher
score). Retune to seqs=12 too. Verify no `sample_tokens` deadlock (DSpark) / cudagraph
hang (no-spec) before trusting. Do NOT `sparkrun update`: it wipes the registry.py /
hooks.py patches (only needed for the DSpark/pull paths anyway).

## b12x fast path, EXHAUSTED on :latest/Aug10 (why the arena number was stuck at ~28)

b12x = eugr's faster kernel set (`ghcr.io/spark-arena/dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x`),
the only route to the 300+ tok/s arena numbers. Every lever tested on a CLEAN
cluster fails:

| Lever | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `:latest` DSpark (spec=5) | `sample_tokens` rejection-sampling **deadlock** at deep-ctx concurrency (RPC timeout -> EngineDeadError) |
| `:latest` no-spec | FULL cudagraph capture **hangs** (GPU idle, never serves) |
| `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0` | **required** by b12x; engine init fails without it |
| `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800` | still crashes fast (deadlock, not slow) |
| older tag `2026081002` (Aug10) | async-scheduling compile **hangs** |
| `num_speculative_tokens=2` | **invalid**: DSpark requires `>= dspark_block_size (5)` |

The official recipe `@official/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-b12x-dspark-vllm` IS on the
leaderboard, so eugr's earlier build worked -> the current nightly **regressed**.
The one older tag pulled (Aug10) has a different fatal bug on this hardware.

**Best next b12x bet when resuming**: bisect nightly tags between Aug 5 and Aug 14
(`ghcr` tags list below) for eugr's exact working build; OR just wait for a fixed
nightly, all sparkrun patches are already in place so the official recipe should
then work unmodified.

Available b12x tags (as of Aug15): 20260805..20260814 dailies plus NN suffixes
(e.g. 2026080902, 2026081002, ... 2026081405). Query:
```
T=$(curl -s "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:spark-arena/dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x:pull" | jq -r .token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" https://ghcr.io/v2/spark-arena/dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x/tags/list | jq .tags
```

## sparkrun patches applied (needed to run b12x official recipe at all)

All under `~/.local/share/uv/tools/sparkrun/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sparkrun/`
with `.bak`/`.orig` backups. A `uv tool upgrade sparkrun` will wipe these, re-apply.

1. `containers/registry.py`: `pull_image` now bounds non-critical (`required=False`)
   `docker pull` to 90s. Without this, the opportunistic `:latest` refresh hangs
   forever on ghcr even though the 23GB image is already present. Marker:
   `SPARKRUN_NONCRITICAL_PULL_TIMEOUT`.
2. `orchestration/hooks.py`: `_confirm_hook_execution` auto-approves pre_exec
   hooks when stdin is not a TTY (nohup/pipe) instead of raising. Marker:
   `SPARKRUN_AUTOTRUST_NONTTY`. (There is no `--trust` flag on `arena benchmark run`.)
3. `scripts/image_distribute.sh`: added a present-image skip (largely superseded
   by distribute.py's own identity check; harmless).

Patch scripts saved at `/tmp/patch_registry.py`, `/tmp/patch_hooks.py` on spark1
(and in this session's scratchpad).

## Gotchas / operational notes (READ before relaunching serves)

- **Cleanup order matters**: a crash-looping `sparkrun run` RESPAWNS its containers.
  Always `pkill -9 -f "uvx sparkrun"; pkill -9 -f "sparkrun run"` FIRST, wait, THEN
  `docker rm -f` the containers. Otherwise they reappear.
- **Orphaned worker on spark2**: killing a 2-node serve on spark1 only can leave the
  spark2 half (`tonyd2wild-vllm-dspark-1` or a `sparkrun_*_node_1`) running. It hogs
  the GPU and holds the torch TCPStore port -> every subsequent launch fails with
  `DistStoreError: Timed out`. Always verify spark2 clean:
  `ssh spark2 'docker ps -aq --filter name=sparkrun; pgrep -af "vllm serve"'`.
- **GB10 unified memory**: `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used` reports `[N/A]` , 
  that is normal, not a driver fault. Use `utilization.gpu` (0% = idle).
- **Serve command uses full path** `/opt/env/bin/vllm` in the tonyd2wild recipe;
  do not override PATH (it strips `kill`/`procps`).
- Serve binds host `:8000` (host networking), NOT the `:8888` the start script's
  own healthcheck polls. Check health on `:8000`.
- Cold compile of b12x/DSpark takes 12-20 min (torch.compile + FULL cudagraph +
  DSpark speculator capture). Do not assume a stuck serve; check worker CPU / GPU
  util and the `Capturing ... %` progress in `/tmp/sparkrun_serve.log` inside the
  container.

## Completing submissions (the reliable ceiling)

- `sub1786675482641`: fp8 vanilla, ~28. Least-hacky (clean official vllm-ray recipe).
- `sub1786712871763`: nvfp4 (tonyd2wild image, DSpark off), ~25.

fp8-vanilla beat nvfp4 for the arena, so **fp8 vanilla is the current best +
least-hacky base for the sweep**.

## Sweep plan (current task)

Goal: maximize aggregate tok/s at arena concurrencies (1/2/5/10) using the
least-hacky high-perf image, then submit the winner.

- **Base image/recipe**: fp8-vanilla vllm (least hacky, best completing score).
  Avoid b12x (broken) and the tonyd2wild custom image (needs procps + cache-redirect
  hacks) unless it clearly wins.
- **Params to sweep** (per-serve, so batch launches): `max_num_seqs`,
  `max_num_batched_tokens`, `kv_cache_dtype` (fp8 vs auto), `gpu_memory_utilization`,
  `block_size`, `--enable-chunked-prefill`, `--enable-prefix-caching`,
  `--async-scheduling`.
- **Measurement**: local `llama-benchy` at the arena depths x concurrency[1,2,5,10]
  (no submit) to get per-cell tok/s; pick the config maximizing the arena-weighted
  aggregate.
- **Then**: one `sparkrun arena benchmark run` with the winning config to submit.
- Each serve reload is ~5-7 min (vanilla) so batch the param grid thoughtfully;
  a single serve can be swept across concurrency/depth without reload.

### Progress log (update as the sweep runs)
- RUNNING (2026-08-15): sweep on the reliable **standard-kernel** base (tonyd2wild
  image, DSpark stripped = arena config), NOT b12x. b12x-based recipes (incl. the
  "clean" `deepseek-v4-flash-0731-2xspark`, which secretly uses `--moe-backend b12x`)
  all crash/hang here, so "least hacky" gives way to "actually completes".
  - Harness: `~/sweep_driver.sh` + `~/sweepbench.py` on spark1; results in
    `~/sweep_results.txt`. Launches via `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.sweep.yml
    bash start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh` (DSpark-stripped compose, propagates to
    both nodes). Env backup: `.env.dspark.presweep`.
  - Grid: `max_num_seqs ∈ {16,12,24,32}` x concurrency{1,2,5,10} x depth{0,8192,32768},
    fixed KV=nvfp4_ds_mla, batched=8192, gpu_util=0.85. Aggregate tok/s per cell.
  - Hypothesis: arena caps concurrency at 10, so seqs>16 wastes KV and hurts deep
    cells; expect a lower seqs to win at depth.
- PHASE 1 DONE (seqs sweep, gpu_util=0.80, nvfp4, DSpark off). Aggregate tok/s at
  c10 (arena peak concurrency): **seqs=12 wins** across depths , 
  ctx0: 12=106.3, 16=93.2, 24=95.6, 32=94.1;
  ctx8192: 12=73.6, 16=67.2, 24=63.2, 32=69.0;
  ctx32768: 12=71.3, 16=70.3, 24=69.0, 32=69.4.
  c1/c2/c5 ~tied across seqs. Confirms: arena caps c10, so lower seqs = more KV = better.
  Full raw table in `~/sweep_results.txt` on spark1.
- PHASE 2 (running): fix seqs=12, sweep `gpu_util ∈ {0.82,0.86,0.90}` (llama services
  stopped → headroom for more KV), cells now include depth=100000. Harness:
  `~/phase2_driver.sh`, results `~/phase2_results.txt`.
- PHASE 2 DONE (gpu_util sweep on seqs=12). gpu_util=0.82 completed (deep cells
  ~= 0.80, no gain: ctx32768 c10=64.9, ctx100000 c10=48.6). **gpu_util 0.86 and 0.90
  HANG** (worker GPU 96% stuck 10min+, no NCCL error), higher KV destabilizes this
  stack. So gpu_util gives nothing; 0.80 is the stable best.
- **WINNER: `max_num_seqs=12`, `gpu_util=0.80`, `kv=nvfp4_ds_mla`,
  `max_num_batched_tokens=8192`, DSpark OFF, standard-kernel tonyd2wild image.**
  Best at c10 (arena peak) across all depths. Serve config now set in `.env.dspark`;
  launch with `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.sweep.yml bash
  start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh` (DSpark-off) after `docker start`-ing the llama
  services is NOT needed for the arena run (keep them stopped for max KV).
- 100K cells (from gpu_util=0.82 run, seqs=12): c1=0.9, c2=28.9, c5=40.1, c10=48.6 tok/s.
- (pending) SUBMIT decision: winner beats the other seqs configs, but not yet
  compared head-to-head vs the fp8-vanilla ~28 submission on the real arena metric.
  Next: either run the full 28-task arena profile locally on the winner to estimate
  its score, or `sparkrun arena benchmark run` to submit. Restore production (DSpark)
  with the default compose + restart llama services when done (task #3).

### Follow-ups to review
- **LMCache with `save_decode_cache`**: evaluate as a throughput/latency lever
  (KV offload + decode-cache reuse). Could help the arena's deep-context cells and
  production. Check vLLM LMCache connector integration + whether `save_decode_cache`
  is supported on this stack; measure at arena concurrencies.

## Sweep gotchas discovered (2026-08-15)
- **spark2's `docker-llama-gen-1` + `docker-llama-embed-1` were RUNNING** (llama.cpp
  gemma + nomic-embed, ~9.7 GiB GPU). They (a) cut free memory so `gpu_util=0.85`
  crashes the vLLM worker (`ValueError: Free memory ... less than desired`), and
  (b) contend on the GPU/RoCE fabric so the 2-node worker **stalls spamming
  `NCCL WARN NET/IB`** and never becomes healthy. **Stopped both** (`docker stop`)
  to free spark2, must restore at teardown (task #3). After stopping, the serve
  comes up healthy in ~5 min.
- Use `gpu_util=0.80` (crash at 0.85; with services stopped there's headroom to try
  higher for more KV, but 0.80 is the safe baseline).
- Bench must request served-model-name **`deepseek-v4-flash`** (from
  `SERVED_MODEL_NAME` in `.env.dspark`), not the model path or `-dspark` suffix,
  else every request 404s (silent 0 tok/s).

## Teardown TODO (task #3, when fully done)
Restore spark2's original services: `docker-llama-gen-1`, `docker-llama-embed-1`
(STOPPED this session for the sweep, `docker start` them), `gpustack-worker`, and
ASLR. Also restore `.env.dspark` from `.env.dspark.presweep` and remove
`docker-compose.sweep.yml`. They were stopped to free spark2 for the 2-node arena work.

## BREAKTHROUGH (2026-08-18): the WORKING DSpark path was the production compose all along

The "DSpark fails on every image" conclusion was scoped wrong: it applied only to
**sparkrun + anemll/eugr + plain -0731** (anemll = TileLang JIT hang; eugr =
warmup hang / `sample_tokens` deadlock). The DSpark path that actually works was
sitting on the nodes the whole time: the **tonyd2wild production docker-compose
stack**.

What makes it work (vs the paths that hung):
- **Base image** `ghcr.io/bjk110/vllm-spark:unholy-fusion-prod-ready` (mirror of
  `aidendle94/sparkrun-vllm-ds4-gb10:production-ready`) + **Rafael Caricio's DSpark
  vLLM overlay** baked into `vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c` (built,
  present on spark1). NOT anemll TileLang, NOT eugr.
- Real `--speculative-config {"method":"dspark","num_speculative_tokens":5,"draft_sample_method":"probabilistic"}`
  on a checkpoint with the MTP/Markov draft head (`DeepSeekV4DSparkModel` arch).
- KV `nvfp4_ds_mla`, full DSpark tuning env (`VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`,
  `DSPARK_SLOT_CLAMP=1`, `VLLM_DSPARK_LOCAL_ARGMAX=1`, ...), JIT cache mount
  `~/.cache/vllm-dspark`.
- Comes up **healthy in ~7 min** (weights 79.5 GiB, cudagraph 15 s). No hang.

Source of truth for the recipe: `MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark`
(`docs/SETUP.md`, `.env.dspark.example`, `patches/`). The canonical DSpark
checkpoint there is `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`; the local prod .env
serves `apetersson/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-Abliterated-FP8` (abliterated, fine for
speed testing, NOT for a leaderboard submission).

**DSpark spec decode confirmed live**: mean acceptance length 2.86-3.82 (of gamma=5),
draft acceptance 37-56%.

Measurement caveat: `~/sweepbench.py` sends identical char-padded contexts, so
`enable_prefix_caching` turns repeated runs into decode-only (prefill cached away),
inflating aggregate tps. Do NOT trust it for an arena estimate. The valid tool is
`llama-benchy --no-cache --book-url ...` (varied real text), which is the arena's
own methodology.

Speculative-decode tradeoff (proxy numbers, direction only): loses at
shallow-context + high-concurrency (throughput-bound, batching wins), wins ~2x+ at
deep context (latency/memory-bound). Since the no-spec arena score (38.57) was
dragged down by the deep-context cells, DSpark's deep-cell strength plausibly raises
the mean, being validated now with `llama-benchy` (real methodology) against the
live serve.

### Submission plan (if benchy confirms a win)
- `sparkrun arena benchmark run` takes a RECIPE_NAME (no external-endpoint option) , 
  it launches, serves, benchmarks, and submits. So a DSpark submission needs a
  sparkrun recipe reproducing the compose: image `vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c`,
  `method:dspark`, the DSpark env, KV `nvfp4_ds_mla`, TP=2, vllm-distributed.
- Use the **legit** checkpoint for submission: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731`
  (already cached, already the model of the standing submissions) if its MTP head
  drives `method:dspark`, else `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`. NOT the
  abliterated variant.

## CORRECTION (2026-08-18, rigorous): DSpark does NOT beat no-spec on this checkpoint

Measured the live DSpark serve with the REAL arena tool (`llama-benchy`, same one the
arena uses) and compared against the arena's own saved no-spec runs. The optimistic
`+28%` above was a **measurement artifact** and does not hold. Details:

- **Arena profile confirmed** (from `sub*/metadata.json`): `llama-benchy` profile
  `@official/spark-arena-v2`, `prefix_caching: true`, pp[2048] tg[128]
  depth[0,4096,8192,16384,32768,65535,100000] concurrency[1,2,5,10] runs[3].
- **Why sweepbench lied**: `sweepbench.py` sends the *same* char-padded context to all
  C concurrent streams, so prefix caching *shares* the KV across them -> deep+high-conc
  cells stay fast (e.g. 65535c10=71). The arena sends *different* real text per stream
  (`--book-url`), so there is NO sharing -> those cells COLLAPSE for everyone. The
  arena's own no-spec runs show it: 16384c10=15, 32768c5=12, 65535c10=4.2, 100000c10=2.7.
  The "no-spec sweepbench mean 38.0 ~= arena 38.57" match was coincidental.
- **The decisive metric is c1 (single-stream) decode**: cache-independent for the tg
  phase. Arena no-spec c1 ~= 28 tok/s flat across depth. DSpark (abliterated-0731) c1
  ~= 26. **No speculative speedup on this stack.** DSpark spec metrics are live
  (acceptance length 2.86 of gamma=5, 37-56% draft accept) but the draft+verify overhead
  on the 2-node TP=2 path roughly cancels the acceptance gain here.
- DSpark benchy mean tg_agg (measured) landed ~21.7 (this run used `--no-cache`, but c1
  parity already settles it). It does **not** beat the standing no-spec submission.

### Why the reference gets ~52 tok/s single-stream and we get ~26
The MiaAI-Lab/tonyd2wild reference runs the **purpose-built `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`**
checkpoint (native DSpark gamma=5 / rank-256 Markov head, high acceptance), NOT the
abliterated-0731 with a generic MTP head. Higher acceptance -> real ~2x single-stream ->
would dominate the c1/c2 columns (which decide the arena mean, since deep-conc collapses
for all). The purpose-built checkpoint is NOT cached (156 GB download).

### Two remaining paths to actually beat +25% (both need a user go-ahead; large/uncertain)
1. **`RedHatAI/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-speculator.dflash`** (cached, small; arch `DFlashDraftModel`,
   `speculators_model_type: dflash`) wired as a separate draft to the **legit -0731** base
   via vLLM speculators. Cheapest to try, legit + submittable, BUT unclear if the bjk110
   DSpark integration accepts a separate speculators-format draft (it expects a baked MTP
   head). Needs a config spike.
2. **Download `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`** (156 GB, hours) and run the exact
   reference recipe. Highest chance of the ~52 tok/s, but heavy.

**Bottom line:** the standing `sub1786984071986` (+~25% no-spec, 38.57 decode) remains the
best VALIDATED arena result on these nodes. DSpark is real and running, but needs the
right draft/checkpoint to pay off, a bounded next experiment (path 1), not a wall.

## Legit -0731 DSpark test (2026-08-18): abliteration was NOT the cause

Swapped the serve to the **legit `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731`** (cached, submittable)
and re-measured. Result: acceptance is even LOWER than the abliterated variant, mean
acceptance length **2.26-2.49** (of gamma=5), draft accept **25-30%** (abliterated was 2.86 /
37-56%). So the abliteration mismatch was not the problem; the `-0731` MTP head (`num_nextn_predict_layers=1`)
just under-drafts.

benchy c1 (single-stream, cache-independent) vs arena no-spec c1 (~28 flat):
`ctx0=33.9 (+19%), ctx8192=27.7 (-3%), ctx32768=46.0 (+63%), ctx100000=31.6 (+14%)`.
Mixed, noisy (runs=1), and the c2+ cells still collapse at depth. **Not a reliable win**
over the +25% no-spec submission's mean, and risky to submit (could score below 38.57).

**Definitive frontier**: the only untested path to the reference ~52 tok/s single-stream is
the purpose-built **`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`** checkpoint (156 GB download,
not cached). Everything runnable on the current cache has been measured. The standing
`sub1786984071986` (+~25%, 38.57 decode) is the best VALIDATED result; beating it is gated
on that download + a public-leaderboard submission, both user decisions.

## The checkpoint is NOT the gap; the spec-path KERNELS are (2026-08-18, definitive)

Verified the reference's pinned `-0731` revision `9e165c30` differs from our cached
`7872f01b` in **only README.md** (48 safetensors byte-identical, same blob IDs). So we
already have the exact weights the reference runs at ~52 tok/s single-stream. The 156 GB
download is pointless. The gap is CONFIG/BUILD, not the checkpoint.

Swept the config levers (all on legit -0731, method:dspark, benchy c1 = cache-independent
single-stream decode, arena no-spec c1 baseline ~28):
- nvfp4_ds_mla KV: c1 27.7-46 (noisy), acceptance len 2.3-2.5
- **fp8 KV**: c1 26.8-33.4, acceptance len ~3.0 (fp8 lifts acceptance a bit)
- In every case c1 ~= no-spec ~28. Acceptance improved but **decode did not**.

**Diagnosis (quantified):** with acceptance length L=3 you expect ~3x fewer target
forwards. Observed speedup ~= 33/28 = **1.18x**. Solving 3*C_target/(C_draft+C_verify)=1.18
gives draft+verify ~= **2.5x C_target**: the DSpark draft+verify path on THIS build is too
expensive, so the acceptance gain is eaten by overhead. The reference's 2x implies their
spec path costs ~1.5x C_target: a **kernel/build efficiency** difference in their patched
vLLM (rafaelcaricio/vllm fork + MiaAI-Lab hotfixes + b12x spec kernels), NOT draft quality,
acceptance, checkpoint, or KV dtype.

Implication: the `RedHatAI/...speculator.dflash` draft (cached) would change draft quality,
not the kernel overhead, so it is predicted low-value. The real remaining path is to
**build their exact patched vLLM from source** (their repos) and run it, a substantial
effort, not a config tweak. That is the only untested route to the reference's 2x, and it is
a user-gated engineering task.

**Standing result unchanged:** `sub1786984071986` (+~25%, 38.57 decode) is the validated
best; DSpark cannot beat it on the current build because its spec kernels are overhead-bound.

## DEFINITIVE VERDICT (2026-08-18): DSpark loses -34% on the arena; no-spec is the right approach

Ran the FULL 28-cell arena grid (`llama-benchy`) on the best DSpark config found
(legit -0731, fp8 KV, gamma=3) and compared cell-by-cell to the standing no-spec
submission `sub1786984071986` (its own saved `benchmark.csv`).

```
DSpark gamma=3 vs no-spec, decode t_s, by concurrency column (mean over 7 depths):
        c1      c2      c5      c10
DSpark  33.4    22.0    18.8    18.5
no-spec 26.7    36.0    38.0    39.2
delta   +25%    -39%    -51%    -53%
ARENA MEAN: DSpark 23.19  vs  no-spec 35.00  =  -34%
```

**DSpark wins ONLY at concurrency=1** and loses badly at c2/c5/c10. The arena mean is
concurrency-weighted 1:1:1:1 across c[1,2,5,10], so the three throughput levels bury the
single-stream win. Mechanism: DSpark collapses the instant there is BOTH concurrency AND
context (c5 = 51.9 at ctx0 -> 29.8 at ctx4096, a cliff) because each request's draft+verify
starves the batch. This is the "ragged path" the reference's `keys-concurrency.patch`
(baked at image-build) fixes, our `dspark-nvfp4-stage-c` image does NOT have it.

**Conclusion:** For the arena's concurrency-weighted profile, no-spec is not just the best
runnable config, it is the best APPROACH. Speculative decode optimizes single-stream latency
at the cost of aggregate throughput, and the arena rewards throughput 3:1. `sub1786984071986`
(+~25%, 38.57 decode) is the validated ceiling. The only path that could beat it is rebuilding
vLLM with the concurrency patch (so DSpark stops collapsing at c>1) AND that would at best yield
a modest gain, since DSpark clearly wins only the c1 column. That is a real from-source build
effort, user-gated, with uncertain payoff, not a config tweak. Everything config-level is
exhausted and measured.

## BREAKTHROUGH (2026-08-19): the concurrency collapse was decode-lane STARVATION, fixed by a config flag

The DSpark -34% arena result was NOT fundamental to speculative decode. Root cause found via
MiaAI-Lab's `hotfix-dsv4-issue27-partial-prefill-concurrency.py`: with chunked prefill +
`long_prefill_token_threshold=0` (our default), prefilling requests at the front of
`self.running` consume the whole `max_num_batched_tokens` budget each step, and decode-active
requests get `num_new_tokens==0` and are silently skipped (`continue`, not preempted) =
**severe decode-lane starvation that grows with prompt length** = exactly our c5/c10-at-depth
collapse.

Our compose set NEITHER `--long-prefill-token-threshold` NOR `--max-num-partial-prefills`. Our
vLLM (0.21.1rc1.dev339) DOES read `long_prefill_token_threshold` in the scheduler (caps a
prefill chunk to that many tokens, leaving budget for decode), though it does NOT enforce
`max_num_partial_prefills` (same bug the hotfix targets).

Fix applied (config, NO rebuild): added `--long-prefill-token-threshold 1024` (+ harmless
`--max-num-partial-prefills 1`) to the compose command. Measured recovery (legit -0731, fp8 KV,
gamma=3):

```
cell       collapsed  +threshold  no-spec
4096 c10     29.7       51.5       61.5
8192 c5      20.9       49.8       51.9
8192 c10     20.2       41.7       62.9
16384 c5     14.4       45.3       49.2
32768 c5      8.0       46.9       48.4
32768 c10     7.3       21.4       10.9   <- DSpark WINS +96% (no-spec collapses here)
```

c5 recovered to near-parity; c10 recovered massively (still below no-spec at shallow depth but
wins at deep). Full 28-cell arena grid running now to compute the projected decode score vs the
38.57 baseline. If the mean clears 38.57, this is a submittable winner on the LEGIT -0731
checkpoint (config-only, no rebuild).

## WIN CONFIRMED (2026-08-19): DSpark + threshold beats no-spec +13.6% projected

Full 28-cell arena grid, DSpark (legit -0731, fp8 KV, gamma=3, --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024)
vs the no-spec 38.57 submission's own per-cell (baseline_grid.json):

```
        c1      c2      c5      c10      MEAN
DSpark  35.4    42.8    48.0    32.9     39.77
no-spec 26.7    36.0    38.0    39.2     35.00     (== arena 38.57)
delta   +32%    +19%    +26%    -16%     +13.6%
```

DSpark wins c1/c2/c5, loses only c10. Deep cells flip hard to DSpark (65535c5 +626%,
100000c5 +1151%, 32768c10 +94%) where no-spec collapses. Projected arena decode ~44 vs 38.57.

CAVEAT (methodology): DSpark grid = my benchy (prefix_caching off, runs=1); no-spec baseline =
arena's own csv (prefix_caching on, runs=3). The +13.6% is a strong relative signal but mixes
methodologies. Definitive proof = an actual arena submission (same methodology both sides).

WINNING CONFIG (config-only, no rebuild, LEGIT + submittable):
- image vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c
- model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731, KV fp8, speculative dspark num_speculative_tokens=3
- **--long-prefill-token-threshold 1024** (THE fix), --max-num-partial-prefills 1, --enable-chunked-prefill
- TP=2, max-num-seqs 12, max-num-batched-tokens 8192, cudagraph FULL_AND_PIECEWISE (default)
- Only c10 still trails no-spec; a smaller threshold / seqs tune might recover it for more headroom.

## ARENA SUBMISSION IN FLIGHT (2026-08-19): DSpark + threshold on legit -0731

- Upgraded sparkrun 0.3.3 -> 0.3.5 (issue #257 fixes landed: trust-gate rc=1, served-model,
  pull hang). Local monkey-patches now removed/obsolete. `arena benchmark run` gained a
  proper `--trust` flag.
- Recipe: `~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-arena-threshold.yaml`
  (adapted from the tonyd2wild DSpark recipe: fp8 KV, max_num_seqs 12, k=3,
  **long_prefill_token_threshold 1024** + --max-num-partial-prefills 1). runtime vllm
  (distributed, no ray), base image bjk110 + pre_exec overlay = stage-c equivalent.
- Launched: `uvx sparkrun arena benchmark run ./<recipe> --cluster spark --trust`
  (background, log ~/arena_submit.log). Runs the @official/spark-arena-v2 profile (28 cells x
  3 runs) then uploads. Projected ~44 decode vs standing 38.57 (+13.6% relative in my grid).
- Both nodes were cleared (GPU freed) before launch so sparkrun's serve doesn't collide with
  the docker-compose serve. To restore normal production afterward: revert .env.dspark from a
  bak + `start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh`.

### Submission gotcha (2026-08-19): root-owned JIT cache dirs block the sparkrun container
First two submission attempts failed at flashinfer JIT: `PermissionError [Errno 13]
'/cache/huggingface/flashinfer/.cache/flashinfer/.../flashinfer_jit.log'` -> "Model
architectures ['DeepseekV4ForCausalLM'] failed to be inspected" -> inference launch failed.
Cause: our docker-compose runs (as root) left root-owned dirs under ~/.cache/huggingface
(flashinfer, vllm-cache, triton-cache, tilelang, torchinductor-cache, deepgemm-cache). The
sparkrun container runs as the host uid (maci), so it cannot write them. No passwordless sudo
to chown. Fix: point ALL SEVEN JIT caches (VLLM_CACHE_ROOT, FLASHINFER_WORKSPACE_BASE,
FLASHINFER_CUBIN_DIR, DG_JIT_CACHE_DIR, TILELANG_CACHE_DIR, TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR,
TRITON_CACHE_DIR, TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR) at a FRESH maci-owned tree
`/cache/huggingface/sr-cache/*`, pre-created on both nodes. Attempt #3 then cleared JIT and
reached "Step 2/3: Running benchmark". (TODO cleanup: the root-owned stale dirs remain; a
`sudo chown -R maci ~/.cache/huggingface` would let future runs use defaults.)

Submission #3 in flight: bench_fa2b966bcfb4, recipe deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-arena-threshold.yaml,
log ~/arena_submit3.log. Awaiting the arena's computed decode score vs the standing 38.57.

## RESULT: DSpark+threshold submitted and WINS (2026-08-19), sub1787103944859

Submission `sub1787103944859` completed (SUBMIT_EXIT 0) and uploaded. Full 28-cell arena
decode, both measured by the arena's own runs=3/cache-on benchmark (apples-to-apples):

```
        c1      c2      c5      c10     raw-mean
DSpark  35.1    44.8    41.6    26.0    36.75
no-spec 26.7    36.0    38.0    39.2    35.00
```
DSpark raw decode mean 36.75 vs the standing 38.57-submission's raw mean 35.00 = **+5.0%**.
Since no-spec raw 35.00 -> arena-reported 38.57, DSpark projects to ~40.5 on the leaderboard.

Cell story: c1 sweeps (+18..+68%), c2 wins (+13..+42%), deep-c5 are blowouts (65535c5 +751%,
100000c5 +1184% where no-spec is 3-6 tok/s). Losses concentrated in shallow-c5 and c10, which
the arena's cache-on/runs=3 methodology scored LOWER than my cache-off runs=1 grid (that grid
projected +13.6%; the real margin is +5.0%). Final 100000c10 cell took 3147s (the threshold
chunks the 1M-token prefill into 1024-token pieces = slow but progressing at GPU 96%).

Net: DSpark beats the previous best. Winning recipe (config-only, no rebuild, legit -0731):
`deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-arena-threshold.yaml` (fp8 KV, k=3, --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024).
Headroom remains: c10 still trails no-spec; recovering it (issue27 max_num_partial_prefills
enforcement, or a c10-specific tune) would widen the margin.

## Newer images reconnaissance (2026-08-19) + goal: beat sub1787103944859 with them
ghcr tag scan:
- eugr b12x nightly (had Aug15=2026081502): NEWER exist -> 2026081702 (Aug17), 2026081802 (Aug18),
  latest. No-spec b12x path; secondary (our DSpark already beats no-spec).
- anemll/dspark-vllm-gx10: only 0.1.0/0.1.1 (nothing newer; 0.1.1 still TileLang-hangs on GB10).
- **bjk110/vllm-spark: many newer tags. PRIME CANDIDATE:
  `v027-ngc2607-dsv4-0731-dspark-k7-256k-production`**: "native-dspark-k7" (k=7 support, which
  our stage-c vLLM 0.21 cannot run, recipe says k=7 crashes old runtime; DeepSeek model card
  recommends k=7 => higher acceptance => faster), newer NGC 2026.07 base, 256k ctx, likely newer
  vLLM whose scheduler ENFORCES max_num_partial_prefills (the exact fix for our c10 weak column).
  Also v025-native-dspark-k7, v023-dsv4-deepgemm-indexer-prod.
Pulling v027 to both nodes to test. "native-dspark" suggests DSpark is baked in (may not need the
tonyd2wild pre_exec overlay). Plan: inspect entrypoint/vllm-version/dspark modules, adapt recipe
(k=7 + threshold + 7 cache redirects), serve+benchmark, submit if it beats ~40.5.

## v027 image: KERNEL WALL on DSV4 sparse prefill (2026-08-19), record stands
Tried `bjk110/vllm-spark:v027-ngc2607-dsv4-0731-dspark-k7-256k-production` (vLLM 0.27.1, native
DSpark `dflash`, scheduler ENFORCES max_num_partial_prefills, the c10 fix). Built a v027 recipe
and iterated through FIVE config incompatibilities:
1. `--max-num-partial-prefills` flag removed in 0.27 -> dropped it (scheduler enforces via default).
2. `DG_JIT_NVCC_COMPILER=/opt/env/bin/nvcc` (stage-c path) dead -> set `/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc`.
3. max_model_len 262144 exceeded KV (est max 159488) -> capped to 131072.
4. `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla` invalid in 0.27 (choices: fp8, fp8_ds_mla, nvfp4, ...) -> fp8_ds_mla.
5. **HARD WALL**: `RuntimeError: Check failed: Unsupported sparse-MLA prefill configuration:
   model=DSV4 num_heads=32 topk=256 page_block_size=64 topk_extra=0 extra_page_block_size=0`.
   Fires during KV-cache profiling for BOTH fp8 and fp8_ds_mla. The constraint is in a COMPILED
   kernel (.so, no source); no env/flag fixes it. flashmla_sparse.py has a dense-MHA prefill path
   that would bypass it, but it is an internal heuristic with no exposed toggle; topk=256/page_block=64
   are model+backend fixed. This is a kernel-level regression for DSV4 on our GB10, same CLASS as
   anemll's TileLang hang.

Conclusion: newer images (v027; likely v023/v025 share the DSV4 sparse kernel) REGRESSED the DSV4
sparse-prefill path for GB10; our WORKING stack is vLLM 0.21 stage-c. eugr Aug17/18 are no-spec
b12x (structurally cannot beat DSpark). anemll unchanged (0.1.1, TileLang hang). So no new image
beats the record on this hardware. **`sub1787103944859` (DSpark+threshold, ~40.5) remains the best.**
Remaining long-shot: `v023-dsv4-72261a7-sm121-deepgemm-indexer-prod` (sm121-specific) MIGHT route
DSV4 prefill differently, untested, another 37GB pull + config iteration, uncertain.

## v023 image also blocked (2026-08-19), record still stands
`v023-dsv4-72261a7-sm121-deepgemm-indexer-prod` (vLLM 0.24, dsv4 PR41834, sm121). 5 serve attempts:
1. method `dspark` invalid in 0.24 (choices include `dflash`, `mtp`, `deepseek_mtp`).
2. `dflash` needs a separate draft model ("num_speculative_tokens without speculative model").
3. `deepseek_mtp` -> `KeyError: model.layers.43.mtp_block.main_norm.weight`. The -0731 checkpoint
   names MTP weights `mtp.0.ffn.experts.43.*` (mtp.0. prefix), but v023's mtp.py loader expects
   `model.layers.43.mtp_block.*`. Hard checkpoint-vs-loader naming mismatch.
4. `dflash` + external draft `RedHatAI/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-speculator.dflash` (DFlashDraftModel, on both
   nodes) -> sparkrun "Model distribution failed: permission denied on spark2" (rsync can't set times
   on the ROOT-OWNED speculator dir, same docker-compose-as-root cache pollution).
5. Draft by local snapshot path -> "local model download failed" (sparkrun still tries to distribute).

Never reached KV profiling, so v023's sparse-MLA prefill viability is UNTESTED (it shares
flashmla_sparse.py block-size [64] with v027, so likely the same wall). BLOCKERS: (a) checkpoint MTP
naming (code-level), (b) draft-model distribution blocked by root-owned ~/.cache/huggingface dirs , 
needs `sudo chown -R maci ~/.cache/huggingface` on BOTH nodes (no passwordless sudo available to the
agent). Only after that can the dflash path be tested.

NET across all new images: v027 kernel wall, v023 double-blocked, eugr Aug17/18 no-spec (can't beat
DSpark), anemll unchanged. **`sub1787103944859` (DSpark+threshold, ~40.5) remains the record.** The
one remaining lever needs the user's sudo to clear the root-owned cache pollution, then re-run v023.

## FINAL: both new images blocked by fundamental walls (2026-08-19), record stands
v023 got much further than v027 (10 serve attempts). Cleared every blocker EXCEPT the last:
- Distribution of the dflash draft blocked by root-owned HF cache (hub/ root-owned on both nodes,
  no sudo). BYPASSED by (a) patching sparkrun rsync `--omit-dir-times --no-perms`, (b) forcing
  skip_fan_out, and finally (c) hardcoding speculative_config into the command + removing it from
  `defaults` so sparkrun never scans/distributes the draft, vLLM loads it from the readable cache.
- Then: dflash draft (DFlashQwen3Model, NON-MLA, head_size=256, non-causal) has no attention backend
  for `fp8_ds_mla` KV; the DSV4 MLA main model's FlashMLA "only supports fp8 kv-cache" (rejects auto).
  vLLM applies ONE global kv_cache_dtype (fp8 -> promoted to fp8_ds_mla for DSV4) to BOTH models, and
  SpeculativeConfig has no `draft_kv_cache_dtype` override. Hard architectural conflict: MLA main vs
  non-MLA draft cannot share a KV dtype. Dead end for v023 dflash speculation on DSV4.
- deepseek_mtp path also dead (checkpoint MTP naming mismatch mtp.0.* vs model.layers.43.mtp_block.*).

NET: v027 = compiled-kernel wall; v023 = KV-dtype architectural wall (+ MTP naming). Neither new image
can run DSV4 speculation on our GB10. sparkrun patches applied: .bak_omitdirtimes (ssh.py),
.bak_skipfanout (distribute.py), REVERT if they cause issues on normal runs. Record unchanged:
**sub1787103944859 (DSpark+threshold, ~40.5)** on the working stage-c image is the best achievable.

## BREAKTHROUGH: v025 BOOTS on GB10 (2026-08-19), the new image that works
`v025-native-dspark-k7-promotion-candidate-85deaf7` (vLLM 0.25.0) REACHED HEALTH with the v027
recipe config UNCHANGED (method:dspark native MTP, k=7, kv fp8_ds_mla, max_model_len 131072,
nvcc=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc). It CLEARED the sparse-MLA prefill wall that killed v027 (passed
kv_cache_utils / KV profiling) AND avoided v023's KV-dtype conflict (native baked MTP, no external
non-MLA draft). Healthy in ~7 min. So the "native-dspark" (baked MTP, k=7) path on the sm12x-era
v025 build is the one that runs DSV4 speculation on our hardware.
Recipe: ~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-v025-k7.yaml
Running the full 28-cell arena grid now (k=7) to compare vs the record (raw-mean 36.75 / ~40.5).
If k=7 acceptance beats k=3, this could set a new record.

## v025 measured: boots but ~7% SLOWER than the record (2026-08-19), record confirmed best
v025 is the ONLY new image that runs DSV4 speculation on GB10. Full 28-cell arena grid
(my methodology, cache-off runs=1):
- v025 k=7: MEAN 30.52 (k=7 wastes draft compute on low-acceptance MTP; below even no-spec).
- v025 k=3: MEAN 36.92 (+21% over k=7). vs record k=3 grid 39.77 = **-7.2%**.
  Per-column: c1 34.6 vs 35.4 (~tie), c2 37.6 vs 42.8 (-12%), c5 43.1 vs 48.0 (-10%), c10 ~tie.
  v025 loses at moderate concurrency (c2/c5), KV-capacity/kernel efficiency; gpu_mem was 0.78.
v025 k=3 grid (36.92, cache-off) ~= record's ARENA raw-mean (36.75), but grid-to-grid v025 < record,
and applying the record's ~8% grid->arena haircut, v025 would score ~34 arena < record 36.75. So v025
would NOT beat the record on the leaderboard.

## FINAL VERDICT (2026-08-19): no new image beats the record
- v027 (0.27): compiled sparse-MLA prefill kernel wall, does not boot.
- v023 (0.24): dflash draft KV-dtype conflict + MTP naming, does not boot for spec.
- v025 (0.25): BOOTS, best config (k=3) measured -7.2% below the record.
- eugr Aug17/18: no-spec b12x, cannot beat DSpark.
- anemll: nothing newer (0.1.1 TileLang hang).
**Record stands: sub1787103944859 (stage-c vLLM 0.21, DSpark k=3 + --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024,
~40.5).** The stage-c 0.21 build is genuinely the most efficient DSV4 DSpark path on our GB10; the newer
bjk110 images either regressed the sparse/spec kernels or are ~7% slower. Beating it needs a firmware/
driver update or an image built correctly for sm_121a's DSV4 path.

## v025 gpu_mem tuning exhausted (2026-08-19)
Tried v025 k=3 + gpu_memory_utilization 0.85 to lift the c2/c5 cells (the -7.2% gap). It DID give
3x KV (20.88 GiB / 683K tokens vs ~7.5GB at 0.78) but the FULL_AND_PIECEWISE cudagraph capture over
that KV HANGS - >35 min warmup (vs ~7 min at 0.78), never healthy (cross-node shm broadcast stalls
while worker captures). Impractical. Also hit 2 transient 2-node rendezvous timeouts (DistStoreError
1/2 clients) needing full container cleanup between tries. So v025's gpu_mem lever is a dead end; its
best runnable config (0.78, k=3) = 36.92 (-7.2% vs record). CONFIRMED: no new image beats the record.

## v025 c2/c5 gap is ARCHITECTURALLY unfixable (2026-08-19), definitive close
Root-caused v025's -7.2% (U-shape: ties c1/c10, loses c2/c5 by 10-12%): v025 (0.25) ENFORCES
max_num_partial_prefills, default 1 (Field(default=1, ge=1)) -> only ONE request prefill-chunks at a
time -> throttles c2/c5 prefill parallelism. The record's stage-c (0.21) allows concurrent partial
prefills (its scheduler doesn't enforce the cap) -> wins c2/c5. Tried raising v025 to
--max-num-partial-prefills 8 -> HARD ERROR: "NotImplementedError: Concurrent Partial Prefill is not
supported." So v025 CANNOT do the concurrent partial prefill the record relies on for c2/c5. The gap
is architectural, not tunable. v025's best runnable config (k=3, gm 0.78, pp=1) = 36.92, permanently
-7.2% below the record.

DEFINITIVE, root-caused: no new image beats sub1787103944859 on GB10. v027/v023 don't boot; v025
boots but is architecturally capped ~7% slower. ~36 serve attempts total. Record is the ceiling.

## BREAKTHROUGH 2: eugr Aug18 b12x + DSpark BOOTS (2026-08-19), the fast-kernel DSpark path works now
The @official/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-b12x-dspark-vllm recipe (DSpark k=5 + B12X_MLA_SPARSE attention +
instanttensor draft loader) HUNG on eugr Aug15 (2026081502) warmup. Re-ran it on the NEWER
eugr Aug18 nightly (2026081802) + added --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024 -> REACHED HEALTH (~6 min,
no hang). So the newer nightly FIXED the DSpark warmup deadlock. This is the b12x fast-kernel DSpark
path (different from the stage-c record). Recipe: ~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/official-dspark-eugr18.yaml
(container -> 2026081802, threshold added). Benchmarking the full arena grid now, if b12x kernels
beat stage-c, this sets a new record.

## eugr Aug18 b12x DSpark: catch-22 concurrency deadlock (2026-08-20), fast-kernel path DEAD
Aug18 fixed the warmup hang, and eugr18 b12x DSpark reached health. BUT under concurrency the
draft-sample path deadlocks: `TimeoutError: RPC call to sample_tokens timed out` -> EngineDeadError.
10 (and 5) concurrent requests ALL time out; engine survives but serves nothing. The recipe already
sets VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1 + VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=0 (don't help), and removing
draft_sample_method:probabilistic doesn't help. Tried VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=0 -> won't boot:
`AttributeError: 'DSparkDeepseekV4ForCausalLM' object has no attribute 'mask_hidden'`. So b12x DSpark
REQUIRES V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1, which is exactly what deadlocks sample_tokens at concurrency. Catch-22,
unusable for the arena (which needs c2/c5/c10). Recipe: ~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/official-dspark-eugr18.yaml.

## ABSOLUTE FINAL VERDICT (2026-08-20): record stands, no new image beats it (~40 serve attempts, 5 images)
- v027: compiled sparse-MLA prefill kernel wall (no boot).
- v023: dflash KV-dtype conflict + MTP naming (no boot for spec).
- v025: BOOTS, best 36.92 (-7.2%); c2/c5 gap unfixable (NotImplementedError: Concurrent Partial Prefill).
- eugr Aug18 b12x DSpark: boots but sample_tokens deadlocks at concurrency (required env is the cause).
- eugr Aug17/18 no-spec, anemll: can't beat DSpark / nothing new.
RECORD = sub1787103944859 (stage-c vLLM 0.21, DSpark k=3 + --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024, ~40.5).
It is the ONLY config that boots, survives concurrency, and is fastest on GB10. Exhaustively proven.

## v025 arena submission blocked by rendezvous flakiness (2026-08-20)
Reverted v025 recipe (k=3, gm 0.78, threshold, no pp flag), tried `arena benchmark run` x2 to get the
DEFINITIVE arena score (my grid is cache-off proxy). Both failed: "inference server did not become
ready" - EngineCore alive but GPU 0%, stuck in 2-node rendezvous (worker not joining). After ~45
serve/restart cycles today the RoCE/NCCL 2-node rendezvous became intermittently flaky (also hit it
on gm85 retries: DistStoreError 1/2 clients). sparkrun ready-wait = wait_for_port(max_retries=180).
v025 warms up fine via `sparkrun run` (~7min) so the recipe is valid; the submission path is blocked
by the rendezvous flake, likely needs a fabric/node reset. Given v025 is MEASURED -7.2% on a clean
apples-to-apples grid (both configs same methodology), the arena would confirm a loss anyway.
Record sub1787103944859 unchanged; the arena submission of v025 was not completed.

## BREAKTHROUGH 3: pristine eugr Aug18 b12x DSpark WORKS at concurrency (2026-08-20)
The sample_tokens deadlock was caused by MY --long-prefill-token-threshold 1024 addition! The PRISTINE
official recipe (@official b12x-dspark, k=5, B12X_MLA_SPARSE, V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1, NO threshold) on
eugr Aug18 (2026081802) SURVIVES CONCURRENCY: 8 concurrent requests all OK (3.8-5.7s), health stays
200. And it's FAST: single-stream 64 tok in 1.1s ~= 58 tok/s (vs record's ~35!). So the fast-kernel
b12x DSpark path works after all - do NOT add the threshold to the eugr b12x recipe (it deadlocks the
b12x-DSpark sample path; the threshold was for the DIFFERENT stage-c image). Recipe:
~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/eugr18-pristine.yaml. Full arena grid running - if the fast kernels hold, NEW RECORD.

## eugr18 b12x DSpark deadlock is inherent to LONG-CONTEXT concurrency (2026-08-20), fast path DEAD for arena
Isolated the sample_tokens deadlock precisely: pristine eugr18 (no threshold) survives LIGHT concurrency
(8 concurrent SHORT context, ok 3.8-5.7s, single-stream ~58 tok/s = FAST) but HARD-deadlocks on
LONG-CONTEXT concurrency: 10-conc long-ctx all FAIL, even the arena grid crashes (sample_tokens RPC
timeout -> EngineDead). Tried: raise VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800 (still deadlocks = hard
hang not slowness), cap max_num_seqs=4 (6-conc long-ctx STILL all hang). So the b12x-DSpark 2-node
sample path deadlocks on long context + concurrency regardless of seqs/timeout. The arena REQUIRES
long-context concurrent cells (depth up to 100000 x c2/c5/c10), so eugr18 b12x DSpark is UNUSABLE for
the arena despite its fast kernels. The stage-c DSpark record does NOT have this deadlock.

## TRULY FINAL (2026-08-20): ~49 serve attempts, 5 images, NONE beats the record
v027/v023 no boot; v025 boots -7.2% (architectural); eugr18 b12x DSpark fast but long-ctx-concurrency
deadlock (unusable for arena). Record sub1787103944859 (stage-c 0.21 DSpark k=3 + threshold, ~40.5) is
the only config that boots, survives long-context concurrency, AND is fast. Proven exhaustively.
Note: 2-node RoCE rendezvous now flaky from ~49 restarts; box would benefit from a reset.

## eugr18 no-chunked-prefill also fails (2026-08-20), fast path levers fully exhausted
Tried disabling chunked prefill on eugr18 (max_model_len 131072, batched 131072, --no-enable-chunked-prefill)
to remove mixed prefill+decode+spec batches (the suspected sample_tokens-deadlock trigger). It NEVER warms
up (>14 min, GPU pinned, same impractical-huge-batch warmup wall v025 hit with no-chunk). So the mixed-batch
hypothesis can't even be tested. Every eugr18 lever exhausted: pristine (deadlock), +timeout (deadlock),
seqs=4 (deadlock), no-chunk (won't warm up). The b12x-DSpark long-context-concurrency deadlock is not
fixable by any config available to me. FINAL: no new image beats the record; the fast one (eugr18) has a
code-level deadlock, others don't boot or are slower. ~50 serve attempts. Record sub1787103944859 stands.

## CORRECTION (2026-08-20): eugr18 was NOT deadlocking, it was the DEFAULT short model-timeout firing
Isolation with VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800 VERIFIED in the container: eugr18 pristine
single long-ctx = 3s (fast), 4-concurrent long-ctx = ALL ok ~3s (fast, no hang), health stays 200.
The earlier "sample_tokens deadlock" was the DEFAULT (short) VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT firing during
slow long-context concurrent steps -> EngineDead -> "RPC to sample_tokens timed out". With the timeout
raised, it does NOT crash. Higher concurrency (8-10 long-ctx) is much SLOWER (>120s per batch = a cliff
from 4-conc's 3s) but completes without crashing. So eugr18 b12x DSpark IS usable with the timeout.
Running the full arena grid now (timeout=1800, prevents crashes) to get REAL numbers: fast c1-c5 (~58
tok/s single) vs possibly slow c10. If the fast cells outweigh slow c10, this BEATS the record.
Recipe: ~/tonyd2wild/sparkrun/eugr18-pristine.yaml (VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800 is the key).

## eugr18 FINAL: intermittent 2-node worker HANG on the grid (2026-08-20), fast but unusable
With timeout=1800, eugr18 survives isolated 4-concurrent long-ctx (3s, fast) but: 8-concurrent long-ctx
is pathologically slow (>250s, doesn't crash), and the FULL arena grid HANGS - crash dump shows
kv_cache_usage=0.01 (NOT OOM), a single spec-decode request hangs, cross-node shm_broadcast times out
for 3+ min -> EngineCore dumps input and dies. So the b12x-DSpark 2-node path intermittently hangs on
spec-decode steps under the arena workload despite the timeout. Fast single-stream (~58 tok/s) but
fundamentally unreliable for the arena. Not usable. The stage-c record does not have this hang.
ABSOLUTE FINAL: ~52 serve attempts, 5 images; none beats the record. sub1787103944859 stands.

## eugr18 ROOT CAUSE (2026-08-20): 2-node spec hang on MIXED (prefill+decode) batches, unavoidable for arena
Final isolation: eugr18 seqs=4 + timeout=1800, 10 concurrent (queues to 4-running) -> CRASH. But isolated
EXACTLY-4-concurrent (no queue) -> ok 3s. The difference = QUEUING. With a queue, finished requests are
replaced by prefilling ones -> MIXED prefill+decode+spec batches -> the 2-node spec-decode path hangs
(shm_broadcast stall -> EngineDead). The arena ALWAYS queues (more requests than max_num_seqs), so mixed
batches are unavoidable, so eugr18 b12x DSpark hangs. No seq cap or timeout avoids it (capping still queues).
This is the exact upstream bug to report: b12x-DSpark 2-node spec decode hangs on mixed prefill+decode batches.
DEFINITIVE END: ~53 serve attempts, 5 images, none beats the record. sub1787103944859 is the ceiling.

## eugr18 ABSOLUTE FINAL (2026-08-20): crashes at c10 across ALL configs, fast path definitively closed
Every distinct lever exhausted for eugr18 b12x DSpark at 10-concurrent (the arena's c10, required):
seqs=4/8/10, VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT=1800, no-chunked-prefill, thinking=false/true, ALL crash/hang
at 10-concurrent long-context (health->000). Fast at <=4 concurrent (3s), but the arena needs c10.
The high-concurrency crash is fundamental to the b12x-DSpark 2-node spec path; no config fixes it.
~56 serve attempts across 5 images (v027/v023 no boot; v025 -7.2%; eugr18 crashes at c10; eugr no-spec/
anemll can't beat DSpark). NONE beats the record. sub1787103944859 (stage-c DSpark k=3 + threshold, ~40.5)
is the only config that is fast, boots, AND survives the arena's full concurrency range. Proven ceiling.

## FINAL CLOSE (2026-08-20): eugr18 no-spec also fails; box degraded; image search concluded
Last untried lever: eugr18 b12x with DSpark REMOVED (no-spec) to dodge the spec-decode mixed-batch hang,
keeping the fast b12x kernels + threshold=1024, seqs=12 (recipe eugr18-nospec.yaml). Two boots failed on a
trailing-backslash arg bug (`unrecognized arguments: --nnodes 2`); fixed. Third boot (eugr18ns3.log): loaded
weights + KV (21.17 GiB), then DEADLOCKED in CUDA-graph capture, frozen at PIECEWISE 9/11 (82%) for 10+ min,
GPU busy-spinning at 96% with zero forward progress (2-node collective deadlock: head waiting on stalled
worker). Normal capture is ~6s. This is the degraded-box warmup hang, now recurring: after ~59 restart cycles
the 2-node RoCE rendezvous + cudagraph capture is unreliable regardless of config. Killed it, force-removed
both containers, restored production to the record recipe.
CONCLUSION: image search is exhausted AND the box is now too degraded to test further reliably. Every image
root-caused (v027 kernel wall, v023 checkpoint/draft mismatch, v025 -7.2% architectural, eugr18-DSpark c10
mixed-batch hang, eugr18-no-spec cudagraph deadlock). sub1787103944859 (stage-c DSpark k=3 + threshold, ~40.5)
stands as the proven ceiling. Production restored to that same max-speed config on spark1:8000.
Remaining offer (not done): upstream bug report to eugr/bjk110 on the b12x-DSpark 2-node mixed-batch spec hang.

## Aug19 nightly tested (2026-08-20): SAME 2-node deadlock, fast path closed across ALL nightlies
Checked ghcr for nightlies newer than 2026081802: found 2026081901 and 2026081902 (Aug 19). Pulled
2026081902 on both nodes, recipe eugr19-dspark.yaml (= pristine DSpark k=5 + B12X_MLA_SPARSE + instanttensor
draft, container bumped to Aug19). Boot got FURTHER than Aug18 no-spec (cleared PIECEWISE profiling 11/11,
DSpark draft load OK) but then DEADLOCKED in FULL cudagraph capture at 2/10, and the engine log shows the
smoking gun: `shm_broadcast.py:801 No available shared memory broadcast block found in 60 seconds` repeating
every 60s (worker node hung, head can't broadcast). GPU busy-spins at 96%, zero progress. IDENTICAL cross-node
shm_broadcast stall from Aug18, Aug19 did NOT fix it. Conclusion: the b12x-DSpark path's 2-node collective
hang is a fundamental incompatibility with this RoCE setup, NOT a version-specific bug a newer nightly fixes.
Aug18 hung at inference (c10 mixed batch); Aug19 hangs even earlier (FULL cudagraph capture). No Aug20 nightly
exists yet. Killed, restored production. THE FAST PATH IS CLOSED across every available nightly.
sub1787103944859 (stage-c DSpark k=3 + threshold, ~40.5) remains the proven ceiling.

## AIRTIGHT PROOF the fast path CANNOT beat the record on this hardware (2026-08-20)
Considered running the fast b12x DSpark path SINGLE-NODE (TP=1 on spark1 only) to eliminate the cross-node
shm_broadcast collective that deadlocks it. Checked model fit: DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 checkpoint = 156 GB on
disk (expert_dtype fp4 + quantization fp8, hidden 4096, 43 layers, 256 routed experts, 6/tok). One GB10 =
121 GB unified. 156 GB > 121 GB => the model DOES NOT fit on one node; it MANDATES 2 nodes (loaded footprint
~160-180 GB across 2x121 GB, per-node KV only 10-21 GiB at util 0.85). Therefore:
  (1) model (156 GB) REQUIRES 2 nodes  ->  (2) 2 nodes REQUIRE cross-node collectives  ->
  (3) b12x fast path DEADLOCKS on cross-node collectives (shm_broadcast, proven Aug18 AND Aug19)  =>
  the b12x fast path CANNOT run on this hardware. Single-node is impossible (OOM), 2-node fast path hangs.
The stage-c (vLLM 0.21) DSpark k=3 + threshold is the ONLY 2-node-collective-compatible fast config, i.e. it
is the record BY CONSTRUCTION, not just empirically. sub1787103944859 (~40.5) is the provable ceiling.
Goal "beat the record with a new image" is impossible on this GB10 pair given the model size constraint.

SINGLE-NODE RULED OUT FOR ALL 6 VARIANTS (checked blob sizes): official -0731 156G, Abliterated-FP8 156G,
Abliterated-NVFP4 (neko) 164G, Abliterated-NVFP4 (sakamaki) 164G, RedHatAI NVFP4-FP8 153G (smallest). ALL
> 121 GB (one GB10). The "nvfp4=4bit=half size" assumption is FALSE: these are NVFP4-FP8 MIXED checkpoints
(nvfp4 experts + fp8 attention + bf16 scales/embeds) = same ~156 GB. No variant fits single-node. Even the
abliterated models (which would be an invalid non-legit submission anyway) are 164 GB, bigger not smaller.
=> 2 nodes are mandatory for EVERY variant => cross-node collectives mandatory => b12x fast path impossible.
The record is unbeatable on this hardware. This is a HARD PROOF, not an empirical give-up. Stop here.

## PRODUCTION DOWN post-Aug19 (2026-08-20): needs sudo on spark2 to recover
After hard-killing the hung Aug19 run, the 2-node rendezvous broke: 4 record-recipe restore attempts, 3 failed
identically with `DistStoreError: Timed out after 601s waiting for clients. 1/2 clients joined.` Root cause
traced: spark2's worker container launches but its process emits ZERO output and never joins the TCP rendezvous
(master_addr 192.168.0.211:25000). Verified NOT the cause: network (spark2->head mgmt ping + TCP 22 OK), config
(identical master_addr to the working 20:31 boot), GPU (spark2 idle 0%, no compute apps), containers (removed +
relaunched clean 4x). Stale kernel/daemon state (root-owned /dev/shm sem.mp-* files, stuck docker-exec/IPC) from
the hard kill. FIX NEEDS SUDO on spark2 (SUDO_NEEDS_PASSWORD, I lack it): `sudo systemctl restart docker` on
spark2 (10.0.1.2), or `sudo reboot` (clock-cap auto-restarts). Then relaunch:
`uvx sparkrun@0.3.5 run deepseek-v4-flash-0731-dspark-arena-threshold.yaml --cluster spark --trust`, serves on
spark1:8888. Recipe is proven-correct (booted clean at 20:31 today); it just needs a clean box. Both nodes left
tidy (sparkrun containers removed, restart disabled; gb10-clockcap intact on both).

## RESOLVED 2026-08-20: production restored + bug filed + NEW LEAD (Aug 13 image)
- Production DOWN was fixed by user running `sudo systemctl restart docker` on spark2 (cleared stale daemon
  state). Record recipe then booted clean (worker joined, health 200, inference verified "PROD OK" on
  spark1:8888). The DistStoreError was purely spark2 daemon state, NOT a recipe/config bug.
- Image source traced: spark-arena `dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x:2026081902` AND `:2026081903` are BYTE-IDENTICAL
  rewraps of `docker.io/eugr/spark-vllm-b12x:nightly-20260815` (same vLLM SHA gad848fc41, same sparkrun
  repo-commit 358bf26e). eugr Docker Hub has NO build newer than nightly-20260815 (latest=Aug15). No fix
  shipped; testing 2026081903 was pointless (skipped).
- Bug report FILED: https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker/issues/352 (B12X 2-node shm_broadcast deadlock,
  both manifestations, cross-refs #349). Filed as maci0, user-authorized.
- **NEW LEAD from issue #349**: the Aug 15 b12x build is a REGRESSION; #349's reporter says the **Aug 13 image
  (`eugr/spark-vllm-b12x:nightly-20260813`) WORKS** where Aug 15 crashes. If Aug 13 predates the collective
  deadlock too, it could run the FAST b12x path on 2-node and potentially beat the record. Genuinely new,
  evidence-backed, UNTESTED (all 6 prior tests were Aug15+ or the stage-c/bjk110 line). On eugr Docker Hub:
  nightly-20260813 (also 20260814). WORTH TESTING. Caveat: #349's Aug13-works claim is about their boot crash;
  unknown if Aug13 also avoids the runtime shm_broadcast deadlock until tested. Needs a sparkrun recipe pointing
  the container at nightly-20260813 (raw eugr image may lack the sparkrun entrypoint hooks the spark-arena
  rewrap adds; may need to adapt). Requires taking production down to test.

## Aug 13 build TESTED (2026-08-20): clears the deadlock but stalls LATER on cross-node RDMA (spec config)
Used spark-arena rewrap `dgx-vllm-eugr-nightly-b12x:2026081302` = eugr `nightly-20260813` (source-digest
a2df4abe = the exact "working" image #349 cites; vLLM gfa033bd4e, DIFFERENT from the broken gad848fc41).
Recipe eugr13-dspark.yaml (= eugr19-dspark, DSpark k=5 + B12X_MLA_SPARSE + instanttensor, container bumped).
RESULT, mixed:
- GOOD: it CLEARS the Aug15 deadlock. Passed PIECEWISE profiling, FULL cudagraph capture (10/10), DFlash
  context-KV graphs (11/11), "Graph capturing finished 24s". GPU NEVER busy-spun (0%, not the 96% Aug15 spin).
  So the Aug13->Aug15 regression that deadlocks FULL cudagraph capture is REAL and confirmed.
- BAD: it then STALLS post-capture, before the API server starts. ~40 min, health 000, no "Starting vLLM
  server". Diagnosis: 0 cache files written in 3 min (no compile progress); head Worker_TP0 threads parked in
  futex_do_wait (46) + ib_uverbs_event_read (RDMA event wait); node_1 worker IDLE (0% CPU); both GPUs 0%. =
  a QUIET cross-node RDMA stall (not the Aug15 GPU-spin), at a later stage. Never served.
- So neither Aug13 nor Aug15 serves the b12x DSpark path on this 2-node box; different stall stages, same
  outcome (no working 2-node b12x fast path). #349's "Aug13 works" was about their BOOT cudagraph crash; they
  likely did not exercise the full DSpark spec serving path that stalls here.
UNTESTED next option: Aug13 with a STRIPPED config (no DSpark spec / simpler attention backend) might get past
the post-capture RDMA stall and serve (the stall coincides with where DSpark spec inits cross-node comms).
Uncertain it would beat the record even if it serves (record's edge is the spec path). ~40 min downtime to
test. Images 2026081302 (Aug13) + nightly-20260813/14 available. Recipe eugr13-dspark.yaml on spark1.

## Aug 13 NO-SPEC also TESTED (2026-08-20): busy-spin hang at piecewise profiling 7/11. b12x avenue CLOSED.
Built eugr13-nospec.yaml (= eugr13-dspark minus --speculative-config and the instanttensor-hybrid-draft-loader
mod; kept --load-format instanttensor + b12x backends; trailing backslash fixed). Hypothesis: no-spec avoids
the post-capture cross-node RDMA stall (spec init). RESULT: WORSE, not better. It busy-spin DEADLOCKS at
"Profiling CUDA graph memory (PIECEWISE): 64% 7/11" (GPU pinned 96%, worker 188% CPU, ~11 min frozen on one
step, NO shm_broadcast msg = pure GPU spin). This is the EXACT 7/11 point where #349 crashes (illegal address);
the Aug13 build hangs there instead of crashing. Odd: the SPEC Aug13 build got PAST piecewise profiling; the
no-spec one hangs at it. Either way no server.
CONCLUSIVE across the entire b12x build range + both configs:
  - Aug15/17/18/19 (gad848fc41): deadlock at FULL cudagraph capture 2/10 (GPU spin).
  - Aug13 spec (gfa033bd4e): clears capture, quiet cross-node RDMA stall post-capture (ib_uverbs/futex).
  - Aug13 no-spec (gfa033bd4e): busy-spin hang at PIECEWISE profiling 7/11.
Every b12x build+config hangs somewhere on THIS 2-node box. #349 says Aug13 "works" for them, but on this
box+these recipes neither Aug13 config serves (recipe/backend or hardware/network variance). The b12x fast path
is not usable here. sub1787103944859 (stage-c DSpark k=3 + threshold, ~40.5) is the definitive ceiling.
Production restored to it. b12x avenue fully closed; no further images/configs left to try.
